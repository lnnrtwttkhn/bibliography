article,Abel2013CB,"Despite the ubiquity of sleep across phylogeny, its function remains elusive. In this review, we consider one compelling candidate: brain plasticity associated with memory processing. Focusing largely on hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents and humans, we describe molecular, cellular, network, whole-brain and behavioral evidence establishing a role for sleep both in preparation for initial memory encoding, and in the subsequent offline consolidation of memory. Sleep and sleep deprivation bidirectionally alter molecular signaling pathways that regulate synaptic strength and control plasticity-related gene transcription and protein translation. At the cellular level, sleep deprivation impairs cellular excitability necessary for inducing synaptic potentiation and accelerates the decay of long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep enhance previously induced synaptic potentiation, although synaptic de-potentiation during sleep has also been observed. Beyond single cell dynamics, large-scale cell ensembles express coordinated replay of prior learning-related firing patterns during subsequent NREM sleep. At the whole-brain level, somewhat analogous learning-associated hippocampal (re)activation during NREM sleep has been reported in humans. Moreover, the same cortical NREM oscillations associated with replay in rodents also promote human hippocampal memory consolidation, and this process can be manipulated using exogenous reactivation cues during sleep. Mirroring molecular findings in rodents, specific NREM sleep oscillations before encoding refresh human hippocampal learning capacity, while deprivation of sleep conversely impairs subsequent hippocampal activity and associated encoding. Together, these cross-descriptive level findings demonstrate that the unique neurobiology of sleep exerts powerful effects on molecular, cellular and network mechanisms of plasticity that govern both initial learning and subsequent long-term memory consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Abel, Ted and Havekes, Robbert and Saletin, Jared M. and Walker, Matthew P.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-15 10:54:46 +0100,2020-12-15 10:55:05 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.025,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,R774 - R788,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleep, Plasticity and Memory from Molecules to Whole-Brain Networks",,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213008488,23,2013,
article,Abraham2014FN,"Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g., multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps.

article,Adam2012ITSCPAR,"Reinforcement-learning (RL) algorithms can automatically learn optimal control strategies for nonlinear, possibly stochastic systems. A promising approach for RL control is experience replay (ER), which learns quickly from a limited amount of data, by repeatedly presenting these data to an underlying RL algorithm. Despite its benefits, ER RL has been studied only sporadically in the literature, and its applications have largely been confined to simulated systems. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate ER RL on real-time control experiments that involve a pendulum swing-up problem and the vision-based control of a goalkeeper robot. These real-time experiments are complemented by simulation studies and comparisons with traditional RL. As a preliminary, we develop a general ER framework that can be combined with essentially any incremental RL technique, and instantiate this framework for the approximate Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. The successful real-time learning results that are presented here are highly encouraging for the applicability of ER RL in practice.",,,,,,,,,"Adam, Sander and Busoniu, Lucian and Babuska, Robert",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-27 19:01:54 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1109/tsmcc.2011.2106494,,,,,,,,,,,,1558-2442,,,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)",,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,2,,,201--212,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,,,,,replay; AI,,Experience Replay for Real-Time Reinforcement Learning Control,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2106494,42,2012,

article,Agrawal2020B,"Cognitive fatigue and boredom are two phenomenological states widely associated with limitations in cognitive control. In this paper, we present a rational analysis of the temporal structure of controlled behavior, which provides a new framework for providing a formal account of these phenomena. We suggest that in controlling behavior, the brain faces competing behavioral and computational imperatives, and must balance them by tracking their opportunity costs over time. We use this analysis to flesh out previous suggestions that feelings associated with subjective effort, like cognitive fatigue and boredom, are the phenomenological counterparts of these opportunity cost measures, rather then reflecting the depletion of resources as has often been assumed. Specifically, we propose that both fatigue and boredom reflect the competing value of particular options that require foregoing immediate reward but can improve future performance: Fatigue reflects the value of offline computation (internal to the organism) to improve future decisions, while boredom signals the value of exploratory actions (external in the world) to gather information. We demonstrate that these accounts provide a mechanistically explicit and parsimonious account for a wide array of findings related to cognitive control, integrating and reimagining them under a single, formally rigorous framework.",,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, Mayank and Mattar, Marcelo Gomes and Cohen, Jonathan D. and Daw, Nathaniel Douglass",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-09-10 15:45:45 +0200,2020-09-10 15:46:23 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.09.08.287276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,sep,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,The Temporal Dynamics of Opportunity Costs: A Normative Account of Cognitive Fatigue and Boredom,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101%2F2020.09.08.287276,,2020,

Specifically, we determine the contribution of subject, day, and scanning session (within a day) to variability in the shape of evoked hemodynamic response.

article,Alink2015B,"Analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern similarity is becoming increasingly popular because it allows one to relate distributed patterns of voxel activity to continuous perceptual and cognitive states of the human brain. Here we show that fMRI pattern similarity estimates are severely affected by temporal pattern drifts in fMRI data -- even after voxel-wise detrending. For this particular dataset, the drift effect obscures orientation information as measured by fMRI pattern dissimilarities. We demonstrate that orientation information can be recovered using three different methods: 1. Regressing out the drift component through linear modeling; 2. Computing representational distances between conditions measured in independent imaging runs; 3. Crossvalidation of pattern distance estimates. One possible source of temporal pattern drift could be random walk like fluctuations --- physiological or scanner related --- occurring within single voxel timecourses. This explanation is consistent with voxel-wise detrending not alleviating pattern drift effects. In addition, this would explain why crossvalidated pattern distances are robust to temporal drift because a random walk process is expected to give rise to non-replicable drift directions. Given these findings, we recommend that future fMRI studies take pattern drift into account when analyzing pattern similarity as this can greatly enhance the sensitivity to experimental effects of interest.",,,,,,,,,"Alink, Arjen and Walther, Alexander and Krugliak, Alexandra and van den Bosch, Jasper J.F. and Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAYLi4vcGFwZXJzL2FsaW5rMjAxNWIucGRmTxEBZAAAAAABZAACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////DmFsaW5rMjAxNWIucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgA9LzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczphbGluazIwMTViLnBkZgAADgAeAA4AYQBsAGkAbgBrADIAMAAxADUAYgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADtVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9hbGluazIwMTViLnBkZgAAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAPwAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGn,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 13:06:07 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1101/032391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Mind the drift - improving sensitivity to {fMRI} pattern information by accounting for temporal pattern drift,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/032391,,2015,
incollection,Aljundi2019ANIPS,"A continual learning agent learns online with a non-stationary and never-ending stream of data. The key to such learning process is to overcome the catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data, which is a well known problem of neural networks. To prevent forgetting, a replay buffer is usually employed to store the previous data for the purpose of rehearsal. Previous work often depend on task boundary and i.i.d. assumptions to properly select samples for the replay buffer. In this work, we formulate sample selection as a constraint reduction problem based on the constrained optimization view of continual learning. The goal is to select a fixed subset of constraints that best approximate the feasible region defined by the original constraints. We show that it is equivalent to maximizing the diversity of samples in the replay buffer with parameter gradient as the feature. We further develop a greedy alternative that is cheap and efficient. The advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing to other alternatives under the continual learning setting.

article,Allen2019WOR," Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired `inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These ``raincloud plots'' can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots).

article,Alme2014PNAS,"The hippocampus is thought to store a large number of experiences that, despite their similarity, can be individually retrieved with minimal interference. Studies have shown that place cells in hippocampal area CA3 form statistically independent representations of pairs of environments. It has remained unclear, however, whether CA3 place cells maintain this independence when the number of environments is increased. We recorded activity from CA3 in 11 environments with nearly identical geometric features. Spatial firing patterns remained uncorrelated across all 55 pairs of environments, with minimal overlap in the populations of active cells. The data suggest that the capacity of the CA3 network is large and speak against extensive recurrence of spatial motifs across experiences.The contribution of hippocampal circuits to high-capacity episodic memory is often attributed to the large number of orthogonal activity patterns that may be stored in these networks. Evidence for high-capacity storage in the hippocampus is missing, however. When animals are tested in pairs of environments, different combinations of place cells are recruited, consistent with the notion of independent representations. However, the extent to which representations remain independent across larger numbers of environments has not been determined. To investigate whether spatial firing patterns recur when animals are exposed to multiple environments, we tested rats in 11 recording boxes, each in a different room, allowing for 55 comparisons of place maps in each animal. In each environment, activity was recorded from neuronal ensembles in hippocampal area CA3, with an average of 30 active cells per animal. Representations were highly correlated between repeated tests in the same room but remained orthogonal across all combinations of different rooms, with minimal overlap in the active cell samples from each environment. A low proportion of cells had activity in many rooms but the firing locations of these cells were completely uncorrelated.

article,Altimus2015MN,"We present results from a novel comparative approach to the study of the mechanisms of psychiatric disease. Previous work has examined neural activity patterns in the hippocampus of a freely behaving mouse model associated with schizophrenia, the calcineurin knockout mouse. Here, we examined a genetically distinct mouse model that exhibits a similar set of behavioral phenotypes associated with schizophrenia, a transgenic model expressing a putative dominant-negative DISC1 (DN-DISC1). Strikingly, the principal finding of the earlier work is replicated in the DN-DISC1 mice, that is, a selective increase in the numbers of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP), while at the same time other LFP patterns such as theta and gamma are unaffected. SWRs are thought to arise from hippocampal circuits and reflect the coordinated activity of the principal excitatory cells of the hippocampus in specific patterns that represent reactivated memories of previous experiences and imagined future experiences that predict behavior. These findings suggest that multiple genetic alterations could converge on distinct patterns of aberrant neurophysiological function to give rise to common behavioral phenotypes in psychiatric disease.",,,,,,,,,"Altimus, Cara and Harrold, Jon and Jaaro-Peled, Hanna and Sawa, Akira and Foster, David J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-07 10:38:19 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1159/000380765,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-9179,,,Molecular Neuropsychiatry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,52--59,,,,S.

The role of this system is only temporary, however, as indicated by the fact that, after damage to the medial temporal lobe, recent memories are impaired but very remote memories are intact. Here we review the evidence that the medial temporal lobe memory system is involved in a process of consolidation: memories are initially dependent on this system but gradually become established in other areas of the brain. We then review some of the ideas that have been proposed about the phenomenon of consolidation and suggest a synthesis of these views.

article,Alvernhe2008JN,"Place cells are hippocampal neurons whose discharge is strongly related to a rat's location in its environment. The existence of place cells has led to the proposal that they are part of an integrated neural system dedicated to spatial navigation. To further understand the relationships between place cell firing and spatial problem solving, we examined the discharge of CA1 and CA3 place cells as rats were exposed to a shortcut in a runway maze. On specific sessions, a wall section of the maze was removed so as to open a shorter novel route within the otherwise familiar maze. We found that the discharge of both CA1 and CA3 cells was strongly affected in the vicinity of the shortcut region but was much less affected farther away. In addition, CA3 fields away from the shortcut were more altered than CA1 fields. Thus, place cell firing appears to reflect more than just the animal's spatial location and may provide additional information about possible motions, or routes, within the environment. This kinematic representation appears to be spatially more extended in CA3 than in CA1, suggesting interesting computational differences between the two subregions.",,,,,,,,,"Alvernhe, A. and Van Cauter, T. and Save, E. and Poucet, B.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-05 15:35:14 +0200,2020-07-05 15:35:59 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.1909-08.2008,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,hippocampus; unit recordings; place cells; spatial processing; rat; spatial cognition,,,,,,,,Jul,,,29,,,7324--7333,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Different CA1 and CA3 Representations of Novel Routes in a Shortcut Situation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1909-08.2008,28,2008,
article,Alvernhe2012AC,"Although rats are able to build complex spatial representations of their surroundings during exploration, the nature of the encoded information is still a matter for debate. In particular, it is not well established if rats can process the topological structure of the environment in such a way that they are aware of the connections existing between remote places. Here, rats were first exposed for four 5-min trials to a complex environment divided into several sectors that were separated by doors allowing either unrestricted or restricted access to other sectors. In the fifth test trial, we measured the behavior of the animals while they explored the same environment in which, however, they faced changes that either altered or did not alter the topological structure of the environment. In experiment 1, closing previously opened doors prevented the rat from having direct access between corresponding sectors. In experiment 2, opening previously closed doors allowed direct access between sectors that had not been directly accessible. In each experiment, control doors allowed us to discard the mere influence of door manipulation. We compared the rats'exploratory behavior in response to door manipulations that either strongly altered or did not alter the ability to commute between sectors and found evidence that the animals displayed differential reactions to the two types of door manipulations. This implies that during exploration rats build a precise map of the connectivity of space that can be flexibly updated and used for efficient navigation.",,,,,,,,,"Alvernhe, Alice and Sargolini, Francesca and Poucet, Bruno",,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,,,,,,,,,2012/05/01,,2021-01-25 17:07:27 +0100,2021-01-25 17:07:41 +0100,,,10.1007/s10071-011-0460-z,,,,,,,,,Alvernhe2012,,1435-9456,,,,Animal Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,359--368,,,,,,,,,,,,Rats build and update topological representations through exploration,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-011-0460-z,15,2012,

article,Ambrose2016N,"Hippocampal replays are episodes of sequential place cell activity during sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs). Conflicting hypotheses implicate awake replay in learning from reward and in memory retrieval for decision making. Further, awake replays can be forward, in the same order as experienced, or reverse, in the opposite order. However, while the presence or absence of reward has been reported to modulate SWR rate, the effect of reward changes on replay, and on replay direction in particular, has not been examined. Here we report divergence in the response of forward and reverse replays to changing reward. While both classes of replays were observed at reward locations, only reverse replays increased their rate at increased reward or decreased their rate at decreased reward, while forward replays were unchanged.

phdthesis,Ambrose2016JHU,"The hippocampus is necessary for the encoding and consolidation of new experiences, as well as implicated in retrieval of memories for planning and guiding behavior. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons, called place cells, are active in a position dependent manner and the population encodes the animal's current location as it moves around, exploring an environment. During pauses in exploration or subsequent sleep, place cells are reactivated in sequences, known as replay, that reflect trajectories through previous or current environments. Since replays are relatively difficult to detect, they are often studied indirectly through events in the local field potential called sharp wave ripples (SWRs). A key piece of evidence for the involvement of replay in consolidation is the increase in SWRs in the presence of reward. Blocking SWRs during behavior interferes with task performance, suggesting that retrieval is affected. Consequently, awake replay is considered a candidate mechanism of both consolidation and retrieval. We used high density tetrode recording to detect replays in behaving rats when reward was increased or removed. Replays that occurred in reverse, the opposite direction of experience, were increased when reward increased while forward replays did not change. We interpret these results as evidence that reverse replays are involved in learning about reward and consolidation while forward replays relate to functions such as memory retrieval or planning. The importance of reward in replay processing is further supported by preliminary results showing that replays occur during reward consumption at higher than chance levels. This data was obtained using a custom application for detecting licking behavior. Our results demonstrate an important difference between forward and reverse replays and emphasize necessity of considering replay content rather than relying on SWRs. We present a preliminary novel program for real-time decoding of replay content, the Online Replay Decoding Algorithm (ORDEAL), which can be used to associate particular replay trajectories with rewarding brain stimulation or other manipulations. The research and technical advances described in this thesis represent a significant step towards understanding how replay interacts with reward, providing a foundation for the continued study of this important topic.",,,,,,,,,"Ambrose, Rebecca Ellen",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 15:50:02 +0200,2020-05-11 15:51:54 +0200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,,Hippocampal Replay and Learning from Reward,,,,,http://jhir.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/40302,,2016,

article,Anderson2003JN,"Hippocampal place cells show spatially localized activity that can be modulated by both geometric information (e.g., the distances and directions of features in the environment) and nongeometric information (e.g., colors, odors, and possibly behaviors). Nongeometric information may allow the discrimination of different spatial contexts. Understanding how nongeometric (or contextual) information affects hippocampal activity is important in light of proposals that the hippocampus may play a role in constructing a representation of spatial context. We investigated the contextual modulation of place cell activity by recording hippocampal place cells while rats foraged in compound contexts comprising black or white color paired with lemon or vanilla odor. Some cells responded to the color or odor changes alone, but most responded to varying combinations of both. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a heterogeneous input by contextual inputs into the hippocampus. We propose a model of contextual remapping of place cells in which the geometric inputs are selectively activated by subsets of contextual stimuli. Because it appears that different place cells are affected by different subsets of contextual stimuli, the representation of the entire context would require activity at the population level, supporting a role for the hippocampus in constructing a representation of spatial context.",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, Michael I. and Jeffery, Kathryn J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-20 14:56:21 +0100,2020-12-20 14:56:42 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-26-08827.2003,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/26/8827.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26,,,8827--8835,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Heterogeneous Modulation of Place Cell Firing by Changes in Context,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/26/8827,23,2003,

We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum. We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments.

article,Antony2020N,"Surprise signals a discrepancy between past and current beliefs. It is theorized to be linked to affective experiences, the creation of particularly resilient memories, and segmentation of the flow of experience into discrete perceived events. However, the ability to precisely measure naturalistic surprise has remained elusive. We used advanced basketball analytics to derive a quantitative measure of surprise and characterized its behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates in human subjects observing basketball games. We found that surprise was associated with segmentation of ongoing experiences, as reflected by subjectively perceived event boundaries and shifts in neocortical patterns underlying belief states. Interestingly, these effects differed by whether surprising moments contradicted or bolstered current predominant beliefs. Surprise also positively correlated with pupil dilation, activation in subcortical regions associated with dopamine, game enjoyment, and long-term memory.

article,Aoi2020NN,"Recent work has suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in context-dependent perceptual decision-making. In this study, we addressed that role using a new method for identifying task-relevant dimensions of neural population activity. Specifically, we show that the PFC has a multidimensional code for context, decisions and both relevant and irrelevant sensory information. Moreover, these representations evolve in time, with an early linear accumulation phase followed by a phase with rotational dynamics. We identify the dimensions of neural activity associated with these phases and show that they do not arise from distinct populations but from a single population with broad tuning characteristics. Finally, we use model-based decoding to show that the transition from linear to rotational dynamics coincides with a plateau in decoding accuracy, revealing that rotational dynamics in the PFC preserve sensory choice information for the duration of the stimulus integration period.",,,,,,,,,"Aoi, Mikio C. and Mante, Valerio and Pillow, Jonathan W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-15 11:17:33 +0200,2020-10-15 11:17:59 +0200,,,10.1038/s41593-020-0696-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prefrontal cortex exhibits multidimensional dynamic encoding during decision-making,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0696-5,,2020,

Then, a demographic profile of the human population is presented to show that the majority of the world's population lives in conditions vastly different from the conditions of Americans, underlining doubts of how well American psychological research can be said to represent humanity.

article,Arnold2016C,"Mental simulation is a hallmark feature of human cognition, allowing features from memories to be flexibly used during prospection. While past studies demonstrate the preservation of real-world features such as size and distance during mental simulation, their temporal dynamics remains unknown. Here, we compare mental simulations to navigation of routes in a large-scale spatial environment to test the hypothesis that such simulations are temporally compressed in an adaptive manner. Our results show that simulations occurred at 2.39× the speed it took to navigate a route, increasing in compression (3.57×) for slower movement speeds. Participant self-reports of vividness and spatial coherence of simulations also correlated strongly with simulation duration, providing an important link between subjective experiences of simulated events and how spatial representations are combined during prospection.

article,Aronov2017N,"During spatial navigation, neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location1,2, head direction3, speed4, and proximity to boundaries5. These activity patterns are thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However, the hippocampal--entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours6. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous, task-relevant variables7,8,9,10. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal--entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.",,,,,,,,,"Aronov, Dmitriy and Nevers, Rhino and Tank, David W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-01 10:33:56 +0200,2020-04-01 10:34:44 +0200,,,10.1038/nature21692,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,7647,,,719--722,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,cognitive map,,Mapping of a non-spatial dimension by the hippocampal--entorhinal circuit,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21692,543,2017,

article,Aspesi2020S,"After decades of debate on the feasibility of open access (OA) to scientific publications, we may be nearing a tipping point. A number of recent developments, such as Plan S, suggest that OA upon publication could become the default in the sciences within the next several years. Despite uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of OA models, many publishers who had been reluctant to abandon the subscription business model are showing openness to OA (1). Although more OA can mean more immediate, global access to scholarship, there remains a need for practical, sustainable models, for careful analysis of the consequences of business model choices, and for ``caution in responding to passionate calls for a `default to open''' (2). Of particular concern for the academic community, as subscription revenues decline in the transition to OA and some publishers prioritize other sources of revenue, is the growing ownership of data analytics, hosting, and portal services by large scholarly publishers. This may enhance publishers' ability to lock in institutional customers through combined offerings that condition open access to journals upon purchase of other services. Even if such ``bundled'' arrangements have a near-term benefit of increasing openly licensed scholarship, they may run counter to long-term interests of the academic community by reducing competition and the diversity of service offerings. The healthy functioning of the academic community, including fair terms and conditions from commercial partners, requires that the global marketplace for data analytics and knowledge infrastructure be kept open to real competition.",,,,,,,,,"Aspesi, Claudio and Brand, Amy",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 12:11:03 +0200,2020-06-11 12:11:24 +0200,,,10.1126/science.aba3763,,,,,,,,,,,,1095-9203,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,6491,,,574--577,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS),,,,,,,,"In pursuit of open science, open access is not enough",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aba3763,368,2020,
article,Aston-Jones2005ARN,"Historically, the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system has been implicated in arousal, but recent findings suggest that this system plays a more complex and specific role in the control of behavior than investigators previously thought. We review neurophysiological and modeling studies in monkey that support a new theory of LC-NE function. LC neurons exhibit two modes of activity, phasic and tonic. Phasic LC activation is driven by the outcome of task-related decision processes and is proposed to facilitate ensuing behaviors and to help optimize task performance (exploitation). When utility in the task wanes, LC neurons exhibit a tonic activity mode, associated with disengagement from the current task and a search for alternative behaviors (exploration). Monkey LC receives prominent, direct inputs from the anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC), both of which are thought to monitor task-related utility.

article,Avants2008MIA,"One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler--Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.",,,,,,,,,"Avants, B. and Epstein, C and Grossman, M. and Gee, J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-13 16:07:52 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.media.2007.06.004,,,,,,,,,,,,1361-8415,,,Medical Image Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,1,,,26--41,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,fmriprep,,Symmetric diffeomorphic image registration with cross-correlation: Evaluating automated labeling of elderly and neurodegenerative brain,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2007.06.004,12,2008,
article,Avrahami1994C,"Although the concept of an event is widely used as the basic unit in the organization of experience, memory and meaning, little attention has been paid to how events emerge or what determines the boundaries of an event. It is usually taken for granted that one knows what an event is or how events are demarcated. In this paper an explanation is offered for the emergence of events, the cut hypothesis, which states: ``A sub-sequence of stimuli is cut of a sequence to become a cognitive entity if it has been experienced many times in different contexts'', and three experiments to demonstrate the predictive power of the hypothesis are described. The stimuli in all three experiments were video films, constructed by randomly assembling short excerpts from movies. In the first experiment the cut hypothesis was juxtaposed with the thesis of demarcation at major changes, and it was shown that, after experiencing a certain repeating sequence, subjects hardly considered dividing at an internal point, even if it was a point of maximal change; points of maximal change were determined on the basis of performance by control subjects who did not experience the repeating sequence. In the second experiment the cut hypothesis was juxtaposed with an associationistic explanation; it was shown that subjects who viewed a certain sequence repeating in variable contexts recognized it better than subjects who had viewed the same sequence repeating always in the same context. In the third experiment a prediction of the hypothesis on recall behaviour was tested and it was shown that experience with sequences of stimuli repeating in various contexts results in cohesion of their elements.",,,,,,,,,"Avrahami, Judith and Kareev, Yaakov",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-28 13:38:00 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/0010-0277(94)90050-7,,,,,,,,,,,,0010-0277,,,Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,3,,,239--261,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,koenigsberg,,The emergence of events,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(94)90050-7,53,1994,
article,Axmacher2008B,"High-frequency oscillations (ripples) have been described in the hippocampus and rhinal cortex of both animals and human subjects and have been linked to replay and consolidation of previously acquired information. More specifically, studies in rodents suggested that ripples are generated in the hippocampus and are then transferred into the rhinal cortex, and that they occur predominantly during negative half waves of neocortical slow oscillations. Recordings in human epilepsy patients used either microelectrodes or foramen ovale electrodes; it is thus unclear whether macroelectrodes, which are routinely used for pre-surgical investigations, allow the recording of ripples as well. Furthermore, no direct link between ripples and behavioural performance has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalogram with macroelectrodes from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex contralateral to the seizure onset zone in 11 epilepsy patients during a memory consolidation task while they were having an afternoon `nap', i.e. a sleep period of ∼1 h duration. We found that ripples could reliably be detected both in the hippocampus and in the rhinal cortex and had a similar frequency composition to events recorded previously with microelectrodes in humans. Results from cross-correlation analysis revealed that hippocampal events were closely locked to rhinal events and were consistent with findings on transmission of ripples from the hippocampus into the rhinal cortex. Furthermore, hippocampal ripples were significantly locked to the phase of hippocampal delta band activity, which might provide a mechanism for the reported phase-locking to neocortical slow oscillations. Ripples occurred with the highest incidence during periods when subjects lay awake during the nap time. Finally, we found that the number of rhinal, but not hippocampal, ripples was correlated with the number of successfully recalled items (post-nap) learned prior to sleep. These data confirm previous recordings in animals and humans, but move beyond them in several respects: they are the first recordings of ripples in humans during a cognitive task and suggest that ripples are indeed related to behavioural performance; furthermore, they propose a mechanism for phase-locking of ripples to neocortical slow waves via phase coupling to hippocampal delta activity; finally, they show that ripples can be recorded reliably with standard macroelectrodes in the human brain.",,,,,,,,,"Axmacher, N. and Elger, C.

article,Azahara2020B,"The consolidation of spatial memory depends on the reactivation (`replay') of hippocampal place cells that were active during recent behavior. These reactivations are observed during sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), synchronous oscillatory events that occur during slow-wave sleep1--9 and whose disruption impairs spatial memory consolidation 4,6,7,9. Although the hippocampus encodes a wide range of non-spatial forms of declarative memory, it is not yet known whether SWRs are necessary for non-spatial memory. Moreover, although SWRs can arise from either the hippocampal CA38 or CA210 regions, the relative importance of these sources for memory consolidation is unknown. Here we examined the role of SWRs during the consolidation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a conspecific, focusing on CA2 because of its critical role in social memory11,12,13. We found that ensembles of CA2 pyramidal neurons that were active during social exploration of novel conspecifics were reactivated during SWRs. Importantly, disruption or enhancement of CA2 SWRs suppressed or prolonged social memory, respectively. Thus, SWR reactivation of hippocampal firing related to recent experience appears to be a general mechanism for binding spatial, temporal and sensory information into high-order memory representations.",,,,,,,,,"Azahara, Oliva and Antonio, Fern{\'a}ndez-Ruiz and Felix, Leroy and Steven, Siegelbaum A.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAaLi4vcGFwZXJzL2F6YWhhcmEyMDIwYi5wZGZPEQFsAAAAAAFsAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8QYXphaGFyYTIwMjBiLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAD8vOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOmF6YWhhcmEyMDIwYi5wZGYAAA4AIgAQAGEAegBhAGgAYQByAGEAMgAwADIAMABiAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPVVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2F6YWhhcmEyMDIwYi5wZGYAABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEEAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABsQ==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-24 10:26:08 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.03.03.975599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,replay,,Hippocampal CA2 ripples recruit social replay and promote social memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.975599,,2020,
article,Azizi2013FCN,"The hippocampal network produces sequences of neural activity even when there is no time-varying external drive. In offline states, the temporal sequence in which place cells fire spikes correlates with the sequence of their place fields. Recent experiments found this correlation even between offline sequential activity (OSA) recorded before the animal ran in a novel environment and the place fields in that environment. This preplay phenomenon suggests that OSA is generated intrinsically in the hippocampal network, and not established by external sensory inputs. Previous studies showed that continuous attractor networks with asymmetric patterns of connectivity, or with slow, local negative feedback, can generate sequential activity. This mechanism could account for preplay if the network only represented a single spatial map, or chart. However, global remapping in the hippocampus implies that multiple charts are represented simultaneously in the hippocampal network and it remains unknown whether the network with multiple charts can account for preplay. Here we show that it can. Driven with random inputs, the model generates sequences in every chart. Place fields in a given chart and OSA generated by the network are highly correlated. We also find significant correlations, albeit less frequently, even when the OSA is correlated with a new chart in which place fields are randomly scattered. These correlations arise from random correlations between the orderings of place fields in the new chart and those in a pre-existing chart. Our results suggest two different accounts for preplay. Either an existing chart is re-used to represent a novel environment or a new chart is formed.",,,,,,,,,"Azizi, Amir Hossein and Wiskott, Laurenz and Cheng, Sen",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-21 19:58:30 +0100,2020-12-21 19:58:48 +0100,,,10.3389/fncom.2013.00161,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5188,,,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,161,,,,,,,,,,,,A computational model for preplay in the hippocampus,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2013.00161,7,2013,

However, the precise information in these recall traces is relatively unknown, with previous work primarily investigating either broad distinctions or specific images, rarely bridging these levels of information. Using ultra-high-field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging with an item-based visual recall task, we conducted an in-depth comparison of encoding and recall along a spectrum of granularity, from coarse (scenes, objects) to mid (e.g., natural, manmade scenes) to fine (e.g., living room, cupcake) levels. In the scanner, participants viewed a trial-unique item, and after a distractor task, visually imagined the initial item. During encoding, we observed decodable information at all levels of granularity in category-selective visual cortex. In contrast, information during recall was primarily at the coarse level with fine-level information in some areas; there was no evidence of mid-level information. A closer look revealed segregation between voxels showing the strongest effects during encoding and those during recall, and peaks of encoding--recall similarity extended anterior to category-selective cortex. Collectively, these results suggest visual recall is not merely a reactivation of encoding patterns, displaying a different representational structure and localization from encoding, despite some overlap.}",,,,,,,,,"Bainbridge, Wilma A and Hall, Elizabeth H and Baker, Chris I",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-09 08:53:34 +0100,2020-12-09 08:53:52 +0100,,,10.1093/cercor/bhaa329,,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhaa329/34753420/bhaa329.pdf,,,,,,1047-3211,,,Cerebral Cortex,,,,,,,,,,,12,,bhaa329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{Distinct Representational Structure and Localization for Visual Encoding and Recall during Visual Imagery},,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa329,,2020,

We propose that the hippocampus supports deliberation about value, given its well-known role in prospection and relational cognition. We assessed the role of the hippocampus in deliberation in two experiments. First, using fMRI in healthy participants, we found that BOLD activity in the hippocampus increased as a function of deliberation time. Second, we found that patients with hippocampal damage exhibited more stochastic choices and longer reaction times than controls, possibly due to their failure to construct value-based or internal evidence during deliberation.

Using functional brain imaging in humans, we show that how long it takes to decide between two familiar food items is related to activity in the hippocampus, within specific regions shown to be associated with the retrieval of long-term memories.

However, in natural environments, planning over multiple possible future states incurs prohibitive computational costs. To represent plans efficiently, states can be clustered hierarchically into ``contexts''. For example, representing a journey through a subway network as a succession of individual states (stations) is more costly than encoding a sequence of contexts (lines) and context switches (line changes). Here, using functional brain imaging, we asked humans to perform a planning task in a virtual subway network. Behavioral analyses revealed that humans executed a hierarchically organized plan. Brain activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex scaled with the cost of hierarchical plan representation and unique neural signals in these regions signaled contexts and context switches.

Using a novel model of cortical event dynamics, we investigate how cortical structures generate event representations during narrative perception and how these events are stored to and retrieved from memory. Our data-driven approach allows us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain activity without relying on stimulus annotations and reveals a nested hierarchy from short events in sensory regions to long events in high-order areas (including angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex), which represent abstract, multimodal situation models. High-order event boundaries are coupled to increases in hippocampal activity, which predict pattern reinstatement during later free recall. These areas also show evidence of anticipatory reinstatement as subjects listen to a familiar narrative.

Associations can be based on relationships between object features (e.g., the three leaflets of poison ivy leaves) and outcomes (e.g., rash). More often, outcomes are linked to multidimensional states (e.g., poison ivy is green in summer but red in spring). Feature-based reinforcement learning fails when the values of individual features depend on the other features present. One solution is to assign value to multi-featural conjunctive representations. Here, we test if the hippocampus forms separable conjunctive representations that enables the learning of response contingencies for stimuli of the form: AB+, B−, AC−, C+. Pattern analyses on functional MRI data show the hippocampus forms conjunctive representations that are dissociable from feature components and that these representations, along with those of cortex, influence striatal prediction errors.

article,Ballesta2020N,"In the eighteenth century, Daniel Bernoulli, Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham proposed that economic choices rely on the computation and comparison of subjective values1. This hypothesis continues to inform modern economic theory2 and research in behavioural economics3, but behavioural measures are ultimately not sufficient to verify the proposal4. Consistent with the hypothesis, when agents make choices, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods5. Value-encoding cells integrate multiple dimensions6--9, variability in the activity of each cell group correlates with variability in choices10,11 and the population dynamics suggests the formation of a decision12. However, it is unclear whether these neural processes are causally related to choices. More generally, the evidence linking economic choices to value signals in the brain13--15 remains correlational16. Here we show that neuronal activity in the OFC is causal to economic choices. We conducted two experiments using electrical stimulation in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Low-current stimulation increased the subjective value of individual offers and thus predictably biased choices. Conversely, high-current stimulation disrupted both the computation and the comparison of subjective values, and thus increased choice variability. These results demonstrate a causal chain linking subjective values encoded in OFC to valuation and choice.",,,,,,,,,"Ballesta, S{\'e}bastien and Shi, Weikang and Conen, Katherine E. and Padoa-Schioppa, Camillo",,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,,,,,,,,,2020/11/02,,2020-12-14 09:53:14 +0100,2020-12-14 09:53:30 +0100,,,10.1038/s41586-020-2880-x,,,,,,,,,Ballesta2020,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Values encoded in orbitofrontal cortex are causally related to economic choices,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2880-x,,2020,

Innovations in pulse sequence design, paradigm design, and processing methods have advanced the field and firmly established fMRI as a cornerstone for understanding the human brain. In this article, the field of fMRI is described through consideration of the central problem of separating hemodynamic from neuronal information.

article,Bandettini2013MI2BAMSFI,"Functional MRI is fundamentally grounded in the hemodynamic response. With an increase in neuronal activity, blood flow increases, causing an increase in blood oxygenation, leading to an increase in transverse relaxation rate T2*. This increase in blood flow is slow and highly variable and shows a considerable spatial heterogeneity. In spite of these limitations, the hemodynamic response has been proven to be exquisitely sensitive to subtle differences in neuronal activity in time, over space, and between subjects. This paper is a brief review of my Keynote address describing some of the effort coming from my group that further demonstrates methods to robustly extract ever more information from both resting state fMRI and activation-induced fMRI. Specifically, I discuss 1) our new method to use multi-echo fMRI time series data collection to separate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal from non-BOLD signal, 2) activation of the whole brain obtained using a simple task and, importantly massive averaging and a model-free analysis approach, and 3) fMRI decoding of left vs right eye ocular dominance column activation with a timing offset as low as 100 ms.",,,,,,,,,"Bandettini, Peter A. and Kundu, Prantik and Gonzalez-Castillo, Javier and Misaki, Masaya and Guillod, Paul",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-07 14:11:11 +0200,2020-08-07 14:11:54 +0200,,,10.1117/12.2012737,,,"Weaver, John B. and Molthen, Robert C.Editors",,,,,,,,,,,,"Medical Imaging 2013: Biomedical Applications in Molecular, Structural, and Functional Imaging",,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,,,,,,,,SPIE,,,,,,,,"Characterizing and utilizing {fMRI} fluctuations, patterns, and dynamics",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2012737,,2013,
article,Banerjee2020N,"Adaptive behaviour crucially depends on flexible decision-making, which in mammals relies on the frontal cortex, specifically the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. How OFC encodes decision variables and instructs sensory areas to guide adaptive behaviour are key open questions. Here we developed a reversal learning task for head-fixed mice, monitored the activity of neurons of the lateral OFC using two-photon calcium imaging and investigated how OFC dynamically interacts with primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Mice learned to discriminate `go' from `no-go' tactile stimuli10,11 and adapt their behaviour upon reversal of stimulus--reward contingency (`rule switch'). Imaging individual neurons longitudinally across all behavioural phases revealed a distinct engagement of S1 and lateral OFC, with S1 neural activity reflecting initial task learning, whereas lateral OFC neurons responded saliently and transiently to the rule switch. We identified direct long-range projections from lateral OFC to S1 that can feed this activity back to S1 as value prediction error. This top-down signal updated sensory representations in S1 by functionally remapping responses in a subpopulation of neurons that was sensitive to reward history. Functional remapping crucially depended on top-down feedback as chemogenetic silencing of lateral OFC neurons disrupted reversal learning, as well as plasticity in S1. The dynamic interaction of lateral OFC with sensory cortex thus implements computations critical for value prediction that are history dependent and error based, providing plasticity essential for flexible decision-making.",,,,,,,,,"Banerjee, Abhishek and Parente, Giuseppe and Teutsch, Jasper and Lewis, Christopher and Voigt, Fabian F. and Helmchen, Fritjof",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-09-04 08:05:34 +0200,2020-09-04 11:05:36 +0200,,,10.1038/s41586-020-2704-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,sep,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media {LLC},,,,,,,,Value-guided remapping of sensory cortex by lateral orbitofrontal cortex,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2704-z,,2020,
article,Bang2018JN,"Brain activity patterns exhibited during task performance have been shown to spontaneously reemerge in the following restful awake state. Such ``awake reactivation'' has been observed across higher-order cortex for complex images or associations. However, it is still unclear whether the reactivation extends to primary sensory areas that encode simple stimulus features. To address this question, we trained human subjects from both sexes on a particular visual feature (Gabor orientation) and tested whether this feature will be reactivated immediately after training. We found robust reactivation in human V1 that lasted for at least 8 min after training offset. This effect was not present in higher retinotopic areas, such as V2, V3, V3A, or V4v. Further analyses suggested that the amount of awake reactivation was related to the amount of performance improvement on the visual task.

article,Banino2018N,"Deep neural networks have achieved impressive successes in fields ranging from object recognition to complex games such as Go1,2. Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning3,4,5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex6. Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration)6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation)7,10,11. Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types12. We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments---optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments.",,,,,,,,,"Banino, Andrea and Barry, Caswell and Uria, Benigno and Blundell, Charles and Lillicrap, Timothy and Mirowski, Piotr and Pritzel, Alexander and Chadwick, Martin J. and Degris, Thomas and Modayil, Joseph and et al.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-08 14:25:56 +0200,2020-05-08 14:26:30 +0200,,,10.1038/s41586-018-0102-6,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,7705,,,429--433,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Vector-based navigation using grid-like representations in artificial agents,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0102-6,557,2018,

Areas that are selective for categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found1,2,3,4,5, but large parts of IT cortex lack any known specialization, raising the question of what general principle governs IT organization. Here we used functional MRI, microstimulation, electrophysiology, and deep networks to investigate the organization of macaque IT cortex. We built a low-dimensional object space to describe general objects using a feedforward deep neural network trained on object classification6. Responses of IT cells to a large set of objects revealed that single IT cells project incoming objects onto specific axes of this space. Anatomically, cells were clustered into four networks according to the first two components of their preferred axes, forming a map of object space. This map was repeated across three hierarchical stages of increasing view invariance, and cells that comprised these maps collectively harboured sufficient coding capacity to approximately reconstruct objects. These results provide a unified picture of IT organization in which category-selective regions are part of a coarse map of object space whose dimensions can be extracted from a deep network.",,,,,,,,,"Bao, Pinglei and She, Liang and McGill, Mason and Tsao, Doris Y.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-10 15:55:45 +0200,2020-06-10 15:57:36 +0200,,,10.1038/s41586-020-2350-5,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,A map of object space in primate inferotemporal cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2350-5,,2020,
article,Baraduc2019S,"Do primates have neurons that encode the conceptual similarity between spaces that differ by their appearance but correspond to the same mental schema? Baraduc et al. recorded from monkey hippocampal neurons while the animals explored both a familiar environment and a novel virtual environment that shared the same general structure as the familiar environment but displayed never-before-seen landmarks. About one-third of hippocampal cells showed significantly correlated firing for both familiar and novel landscapes. These correlations hinged on space or task elements, rather than on immediate visual information. The functional features of these cells are analogous to human concept cells, which represent the meaning of a specific stimulus rather than its apparent visual properties.Science, this issue p. 635Concept cells in the human hippocampus encode the meaning conveyed by stimuli over their perceptual aspects. Here we investigate whether analogous cells in the macaque can form conceptual schemas of spatial environments. Each day, monkeys were presented with a familiar and a novel virtual maze, sharing a common schema but differing by surface features (landmarks). In both environments, animals searched for a hidden reward goal only defined in relation to landmarks. With learning, many neurons developed a firing map integrating goal-centered and task-related information of the novel maze that matched that for the familiar maze. Thus, these hippocampal cells abstract the spatial concepts from the superficial details of the environment and encode space into a schema-like representation.",,,,,,,,,"Baraduc, P. and Duhamel, J.-R. and Wirth, S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-20 15:08:54 +0100,2020-12-20 15:09:20 +0100,,,10.1126/science.aav5404,,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/635.full.pdf,,,,,,0036-8075,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6427,,,635--639,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,,,Schema cells in the macaque hippocampus,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/635,363,2019,

article,Barne2020B,"Being able to anticipate events before they happen facilitates stimulus processing. The anticipation of the contents of events is thought to be implemented by the elicitation of prestimulus templates in sensory cortex. In contrast, the anticipation of the timing of events is typically associated with entrainment of neural oscillations. It is so far unknown whether temporal expectations interact with feature-based expectations, and, consequently, whether entrainment modulates the generation of content-specific sensory templates. In this study, we investigated the role of temporal expectations in a sensory discrimination task. We presented participants with rhythmically interleaved visual and auditory streams of relevant and irrelevant stimuli while measuring neural activity using magnetoencephalography. We found no evidence that rhythmic stimulation induced prestimulus feature templates. However, we did observe clear anticipatory rhythmic pre-activation of the relevant sensory cortices. This oscillatory activity peaked at behaviourally relevant, in-phase, intervals. Our results suggest that temporal expectations about stimulus features do not behave similarly to explicitly cued, non-rhythmic, expectations; yet elicit a distinct form of modality-specific pre-activation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Barne, Louise Catheryne and Cravo, Andr{\'e} Mascioli and de Lange, Floris P. and Spaak, Eelke",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 10:23:42 +0100,2020-10-26 10:24:06 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.10.20.347005,,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/21/2020.10.20.347005.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Temporal prediction elicits rhythmic pre-activation of relevant sensory cortices,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/21/2020.10.20.347005,,2020,
article,Barr2013JML,"Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.",,,,,,,,,"Barr, Dale J. and Levy, Roger and Scheepers, Christoph and Tily, Harry J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-24 10:22:23 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.jml.2012.11.001,,,,,,,,,,,,0749596X,,,Journal of Memory and Language,,,"Generalization, Linear mixed-effects models, Monte Carlo simulation, Statistics",,,,,,,,,,,3,,,255--278,,,,Elsevier Inc.,,,,,,highspeed,,{Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal},,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2012.11.001,68,2013,
article,Barron2016N,"Balance of cortical excitation and inhibition (EI) is thought to be disrupted in several neuropsychiatric conditions, yet it is not clear how it is maintained in the healthy human brain. When EI balance is disturbed during learning and memory in animal models, it can be restabilized via formation of inhibitory replicas of newly formed excitatory connections. Here we assess evidence for such selective inhibitory rebalancing in humans. Using fMRI repetition suppression we measure newly formed cortical associations in the human brain. We show that expression of these associations reduces over time despite persistence in behavior, consistent with inhibitory rebalancing. To test this, we modulated excitation/inhibition balance with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Using ultra-high-field (7T) MRI and spectroscopy, we show that reducing GABA allows cortical associations to be re-expressed. This suggests that in humans associative memories are stored in balanced excitatory-inhibitory ensembles that lie dormant unless latent inhibitory connections are unmasked.",,,,,,,,,"Barron, H.C. and Vogels, T.P. and Emir, U.E. and Makin, T.R. and O'Shea, J. and Clare, S. and Jbabdi, S. and Dolan, R.J. and Behrens, T.E.J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-17 15:43:50 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.031,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,1,,,191--203,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Unmasking Latent Inhibitory Connections in Human Cortex to Reveal Dormant Cortical Memories,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.031,90,2016,

The specialised biological mechanisms that permit continual learning in humans and other mammals are not fully understood. Here I explore the possibility that neural inhibition plays an important role. I present recent findings from studies in humans that suggest inhibition regulates the stability of neural networks to gate cortical plasticity and memory retrieval. These studies use non-invasive methods to obtain an indirect measure of neural inhibition and corroborate comparable findings in animals.

A likely novel experience was constructed by invoking multiple independent memories in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. This construction persisted for only a short time period, during which new associations were observed between the memories for component items.

article,Barron2016PTRSBS,"Understanding how the human brain gives rise to complex cognitive processes remains one of the biggest challenges of contemporary neuroscience. While invasive recording in animal models can provide insight into neural processes that are conserved across species, our understanding of cognition more broadly relies upon investigation of the human brain itself. There is therefore an imperative to establish non-invasive tools that allow human brain activity to be measured at high spatial and temporal resolution. In recent years, various attempts have been made to refine the coarse signal available in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), providing a means to investigate neural activity at the meso-scale, i.e. at the level of neural populations. The most widely used techniques include repetition suppression and multivariate pattern analysis. Human neuroscience can now use these techniques to investigate how representations are encoded across neural populations and transformed by relevant computations. Here, we review the physiological basis, applications and limitations of fMRI repetition suppression with a brief comparison to multivariate techniques. By doing so, we show how fMRI repetition suppression holds promise as a tool to reveal complex neural mechanisms that underlie human cognitive function.",,,,,,,,,"Barron, Helen C. and Garvert, Mona M. and Behrens, Timothy E.

Here, we use a multi-day cross-species approach in humans and mice to report the functional anatomy and neuronal computation underlying inferential decisions. We show that during successful inference, the mammalian brain uses a hippocampal prospective code to forecast temporally structured learned associations. Moreover, during resting behavior, coactivation of hippocampal cells in sharp-wave/ripples represent inferred relationships that include reward, thereby ``joining-the-dots'' between events that have not been observed together but lead to profitable outcomes.

article,Barron2017PNAS,"Nervous systems use excitatory cell assemblies to encode and represent sensory percepts. Similarly, synaptically connected cell assemblies or ``engrams'' are thought to represent memories of past experience. Multiple lines of recent evidence indicate that brain systems create and use inhibitory replicas of excitatory representations for important cognitive functions. Such matched ``inhibitory engrams'' can form through homeostatic potentiation of inhibition onto postsynaptic cells that show increased levels of excitation. Inhibitory engrams can reduce behavioral responses to familiar stimuli, thereby resulting in behavioral habituation. In addition, by preventing inappropriate activation of excitatory memory engrams, inhibitory engrams can make memories quiescent, stored in a latent form that is available for context-relevant activation. In neural networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory engrams, the release of innate responses and recall of associative memories can occur through focused disinhibition. Understanding mechanisms that regulate the formation and expression of inhibitory engrams in vivo may help not only to explain key features of cognition but also to provide insight into transdiagnostic traits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder.",,,,,,,,,"Barron, Helen C. and Vogels, Tim P. and Behrens, Timothy E. and Ramaswami, Mani",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-17 15:46:19 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1073/pnas.1701812114,,,,,,,,,,,,1091-6490,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,201701812,,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Inhibitory engrams in perception and memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1701812114,,2017,

Here, we explored the dlPFC computations related to updating current beliefs during stochastic reversal learning. We recorded the activity of populations up to 1,000 neurons, simultaneously, in two male macaques while they executed a two-armed bandit reversal learning task. Behavioral analyses using a Bayesian framework showed that animals inferred reversals and switched their choice preference rapidly, rather than slowly updating choice values, consistent with state inference.

article,Bates2015JSS,"Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",,,,,,,,,"Bates, Douglas and M{\""a}chler, Martin and Bolker, Ben and Walker, Steve",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-25 14:44:12 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.18637/jss.v067.i01,,,,,,,,,,,,1548-7660,,,Journal of Statistical Software,,,sparse matrix methods; linear mixed models; penalized least squares; Cholesky decomposition,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1--48,,,,,,,,,,,,Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using {lme4},,,,,https://www.jstatsoft.org/v067/i01,67,2015,
article,Battaglia2004LM,"The sleeping neocortex shows nested oscillatory activity in different frequency ranges, characterized by fluctuations between ``up-states'' and ``down-states.'' High-density neuronal ensemble recordings in rats now reveal the interaction between synchronized activity in the hippocampus and neocortex: Electroencephalographic sharp waves in the hippocampus were more probable during down-states than during up-states, and tended to coincide with transitions from down-states to up-states. The form of cortical activity fluctuations and their interactions with sharp waves depend on sleep depth: In deeper sleep stages, characterized by strong neocortical oscillation in the delta range or slower (∼0.8-4 Hz), sharp-wave-triggered peri-event time histograms (PETH) are consistent with a longer duration for down-states than for up-states. In lighter sleep, the sharp-wave-triggered PETH suggested longer up-states than down-states. These results highlight the interplay in the hippocampal/neocortical loop: Decreased neocortical input during down-states may be a factor in generation of sharp waves. In turn, sharp waves may facilitate down-to-up transitions. This interplay may reflect joint memory trace reactivation in the hippocampus and in the neocortex, possibly contributing to consolidation of long-term memory: Off-line reactivation of recent neural activity patterns in the hippocampus occurs during 50-100-msec electroencephalographic sharp waves, corresponding to pyramidal-cell population bursts. The neocortical up-states starting in correspondence with sharp waves may be influenced by the reactivated information carried by the hippocampal sharp wave. ",,,,,,,,,"Battaglia, F.

A network of this type has been suggested as a model for the origin of place cells in the hippocampus of rodents. The extremely diluted and fully connected limits are studied, and the storage capacity and the information capacity are found. The important parameters determining the performance of the network are the sparsity of the spatial representations and the degree of connectivity, as found already for the storage of individual memory patterns in the general theory of autoassociative networks.

article,Battaglia2011TCS,"A complex brain network, centered on the hippocampus, supports episodic memories throughout their lifetimes. Classically, upon memory encoding during active behavior, hippocampal activity is dominated by theta oscillations (6--10 Hz). During inactivity, hippocampal neurons burst synchronously, constituting sharp waves, which can propagate to other structures, theoretically supporting memory consolidation. This `two-stage' model has been updated by new data from high-density electrophysiological recordings in animals that shed light on how information is encoded and exchanged between hippocampus, neocortex and subcortical structures such as the striatum. Cell assemblies (tightly related groups of cells) discharge together and synchronize across brain structures orchestrated by theta, sharp waves and slow oscillations, to encode information.

article,Batterink2019TCS,"Both implicit learning and statistical learning focus on the ability of learners to pick up on patterns in the environment. It has been suggested that these two lines of research may be combined into a single construct of ``implicit statistical learning.'' However, by comparing the neural processes that give rise to implicit versus statistical learning, we may determine the extent to which these two learning paradigms do indeed describe the same core mechanisms. In this review, we describe current knowledge about neural mechanisms underlying both implicit learning and statistical learning, highlighting converging findings between these two literatures. A common thread across all paradigms is that learning is supported by interactions between the declarative and nondeclarative memory systems of the brain. We conclude by discussing several outstanding research questions and future directions for each of these two research fields. Moving forward, we suggest that the two literatures may interface by defining learning according to experimental paradigm, with ``implicit learning'' reserved as a specific term to denote learning without awareness, which may potentially occur across all paradigms. By continuing to align these two strands of research, we will be in a better position to characterize the neural bases of both implicit and statistical learning, ultimately improving our understanding of core mechanisms that underlie a wide variety of human cognitive abilities.",,,,,,,,,"Batterink, Laura J. and Paller, Ken A. and Reber, Paul J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 15:48:23 +0100,2020-10-26 16:43:00 +0100,,,10.1111/tops.12420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Topics in Cognitive Science,,,,,,,,,,,apr,,,,,,,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Understanding the Neural Bases of Implicit and Statistical Learning,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12420,,2019,

article,Behrens2018N,"It is proposed that a cognitive map encoding the relationships between entities in the world supports flexible behavior, but the majority of the neural evidence for such a system comes from studies of spatial navigation. Recent work describing neuronal parallels between spatial and non-spatial behaviors has rekindled the notion of a systematic organization of knowledge across multiple domains. We review experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks that point to principles unifying these apparently disparate functions. These principles describe how to learn and use abstract, generalizable knowledge and suggest that map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds. We highlight how artificial agents endowed with such principles exhibit flexible behavior and learn map-like representations observed in the brain.

article,Behzadi2007N,"A component based method (CompCor) for the reduction of noise in both blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented. In the proposed method, significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise ROI are considered. The first method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the time series data. With the application of CompCor, the temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the application of CompCor significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for functional BOLD data, there were significantly more activated voxels detected with CompCor as compared to RETROICOR.

A potential mechanism for memory consolidation depends on the reactivation of neuronal sequences in the hippocampus. Despite abundant evidence of sequence reactivation in the formation of spatial memory, the reactivation of hippocampal neuronal sequences carrying non-spatial information has been much less explored. In this work, we recorded the activity of time cell sequences while rats performed multiple 15-s treadmill runnings during the intertrial intervals of a spatial alternation memory task. We observed forward and reverse reactivations of time cell sequences often occurring during sharp-wave ripple events following reward consumption.

Subjects performed a lexical decision task using word and nonword stimuli rotated 0$\,^{\circ}$, 60$\,^{\circ}$, or 120$\,^{\circ}$. Averaged hemodynamic responses to repeated stimulation were fit to a Gamma-variate function convolved with a heavyside function of varying onset and duration to estimate each voxel's activation delay and width. Consistent with prolonged reaction times for the rotated stimuli and nonwords, the motor cortex showed delayed hemodynamic onset for both conditions. Language areas such as the lingual gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus all showed delayed hemodynamic onsets to rotated stimuli but not to nonword stimuli. The inferior frontal gyrus showed both increased onset latency for rotated stimuli and a wider hemodynamic response to nonwords, consistent with prolonged processing in this area during the lexical decision task. Phonological processing areas such as superior temporal and angular gyrus showed no delay or width difference for rotated stimuli. These results suggest that phonological routes but not semantic routes to the lexicon can proceed regardless of stimulus orientation.

What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy are concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological, has come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them.

article,Bellmund2018S,"Ever since Tolman{\textquoteright}s proposal of cognitive maps in the 1940s, the question of how spatial representations support flexible behavior has been a contentious topic. Bellmund et al. review and combine concepts from cognitive science and philosophy with findings from neurophysiology of spatial navigation in rodents to propose a framework for cognitive neuroscience. They argue that spatial-processing principles in the hippocampalentorhinal region provide a geometric code to map information domains of cognitive spaces for high-level cognition and discuss recent evidence for this proposal.Science, this issue p. eaat6766BACKGROUNDEver since Edward Tolman{\textquoteright}s proposal that comprehensive cognitive maps underlie spatial navigation and, more generally, psychological functions, the question of how past experience guides behavior has been contentious. The discovery of place cells in rodents, signaling the animal{\textquoteright}s position in space, suggested that such cognitive maps reside in the hippocampus, a core brain region for human memory. Building on the description of place cells, several other functionally defined cell types were discovered in the hippocampal-entorhinal region. Among them are grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, whose characteristic periodic, six-fold symmetric firing patterns are thought to provide a spatial metric. These findings were complemented by insights into key coding principles of the hippocampal-entorhinal region: Spatial representations vary in scale along the hippocampal long axis, place cells remap to map different environments, and sequential hippocampal activity represents nonlocal trajectories through space. In humans, the existence of spatially tuned cells has been demonstrated in presurgical patients, and functional magnetic resonance imaging provides proxy measures for the noninvasive investigation of these processing mechanisms in human cognition. Intriguingly, recent advances indicate that place and grid cells can encode positions along dimensions of experience beyond Euclidean space for navigation, suggesting a more general role of hippocampal-entorhinal processing mechanisms in cognition.ADVANCESWe combine hippocampal-entorhinal processing mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research with ideas from cognitive science describing a spatial representational format for cognition. Cognitive spaces are spanned by dimensions satisfying geometric constraints such as betweenness and equidistance, enabling the representation of properties and concepts as convex regions of cognitive space. We propose that the continuous population code of place and grid cells in the hippocampal-entorhinal region maps the dimensions of cognitive spaces. In these, each stimulus is located according to its feature values along the relevant dimensions, resulting in nearby positions for similar stimuli and larger distances between dissimilar stimuli. The low-dimensional, rigid firing properties of the entorhinal grid system make it a candidate to provide a metric or distance code for cognitive spaces, whereas hippocampal place cells flexibly represent positions in a given space. This mapping of cognitive spaces is complemented by the additional coding principles outlined above: Along the hippocampal long axis, cognitive spaces are mapped with varying spatial scale, supporting memory and knowledge representations at different levels of granularity. Via hippocampal remapping, spaces spanned by different dimensions can be flexibly mapped and established maps can be reinstated via attractor dynamics. The geometric definition of cognitive spaces allows flexible generalization and inference, and sequential hippocampal activity can simulate trajectories through cognitive spaces for adaptive decision-making and behavior.OUTLOOKCognitive spaces provide a domain-general format for processing in the hippocampal-entorhinal region, in line with its involvement beyond navigation and memory. Spatial navigation serves as a model system to identify key coding principles governing cognitive spaces. An important question concerns the extent to which firing properties of spatially tuned cells are preserved in cognitive spaces. Technological advances such as calcium imaging will clarify coding principles on the population level and facilitate the translation to human cognitive neuroscience. Spatial navigation is mostly investigated in two dimensions and naturally limited to three dimensions; however, the processing of complex, multidimensional concepts is vital to high-level human cognition, and the representation of such high-dimensional spaces is an intriguing question for future research. Further, the role of brain networks acting in concert with the hippocampus, in navigation specifically and cognitive function in general, will provide insight into whether and how cognitive spaces are supported beyond the hippocampal-entorhinal region. Finally, the precise way in which cognitive spaces and trajectories through them are read out for behavior remains to be elucidated.Place and grid cells map cognitive spaces.Cognitive spaces are defined by dimensions satisfying geometric constraints. The example space (left) is spanned by the dimensions of engine power and car weight. Black dots show different vehicles whose positions reflect their feature combinations. Place cells (center; colored circles represent firing fields of different cells) and grid cells (right; circles illustrate firing pattern of one cell) provide a continuous code for cognitive spaces.The hippocampal formation has long been suggested to underlie both memory formation and spatial navigation. We discuss how neural mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research operate across information domains to support a wide spectrum of cognitive functions. In our framework, place and grid cell population codes provide a representational format to map variable dimensions of cognitive spaces. This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Bellmund, Jacob L.

Rodent single-cell recordings suggest the ability of spatially tuned cells to represent subsequent locations. Grid-like representations have been observed in the human entorhinal cortex during virtual and imagined navigation. However, hitherto it remains unknown if grid-like representations contribute to mental simulation in the absence of imagined movement. Participants imagined directions between building locations in a large-scale virtual-reality city while undergoing fMRI without re-exposure to the environment. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we provide evidence for representations of absolute imagined direction at a resolution of 30$\,^{\circ}$ in the parahippocampal gyrus, consistent with the head-direction system. Furthermore, we capitalize on the six-fold rotational symmetry of grid-cell firing to demonstrate a 60$\,^{\circ}$ periodic pattern-similarity structure in the entorhinal cortex.

article,Ben-Yakov2018JN,"The function of the human hippocampus is normally investigated by experimental manipulation of discrete events. Less is known about what triggers hippocampal activity during more naturalistic, continuous experience. We hypothesized that the hippocampus would be sensitive to the occurrence of event boundaries, that is, moments in time identified by observers as a transition between events. To address this, we analyzed functional MRI data from two groups: one (n = 253, 131 female) who viewed an 8.5 min film and another (n = 15, 6 female) who viewed a 120 min film. We observed a strong hippocampal response at boundaries defined by independent observers, which was modulated by boundary salience (the number of observers that identified each boundary). In the longer film, there were sufficient boundaries to show that this modulation remained after covarying out a large number of perceptual factors. This hypothesis-driven approach was complemented by a data-driven approach, in which we identified hippocampal events as moments in time with the strongest hippocampal activity. The correspondence between these hippocampal events and event boundaries was highly significant, revealing that the hippocampal response is not only sensitive, but also specific to event boundaries. We conclude that event boundaries play a key role in shaping hippocampal activity during encoding of naturalistic events.",,,,,,,,,"Ben-Yakov, Aya and Henson, Richard N.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAdLi4vcGFwZXJzL2Jlbi15YWtvdjIwMThqbi5wZGZPEQF2AAAAAAF2AAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8TYmVuLXlha292MjAxOGpuLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAEIvOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOmJlbi15YWtvdjIwMThqbi5wZGYADgAoABMAYgBlAG4ALQB5AGEAawBvAHYAMgAwADEAOABqAG4ALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgBAVXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvYmVuLXlha292MjAxOGpuLnBkZgATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABEAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb4=,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 10:25:41 +0200,2020-04-15 10:26:33 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.0524-18.2018,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,47,,,10057--10068,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,The Hippocampal Film Editor: Sensitivity and Specificity to Event Boundaries in Continuous Experience,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0524-18.2018,38,2018,

Coherence peaked at the choice point, most strongly after task rule acquisition. Simultaneously, Pfc pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta trough, and synchronous cell assemblies emerged. This synchronous state may result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found similar hippocampal-Pfc theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves.

To test this, we trained rats on an auditory-spatial association task while recording from neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus.

This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.",,,,,,,,,"Bengio, Y. and Courville, A. and Vincent, P.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAeLi4vcGFwZXJzL2JlbmdpbzIwMTNpdHBhbWkucGRmTxEBfAAAAAABfAACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////FGJlbmdpbzIwMTNpdHBhbWkucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBDLzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpiZW5naW8yMDEzaXRwYW1pLnBkZgAADgAqABQAYgBlAG4AZwBpAG8AMgAwADEAMwBpAHQAcABhAG0AaQAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASAEFVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9iZW5naW8yMDEzaXRwYW1pLnBkZgAAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQARQAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHF,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-18 11:09:39 +0200,2020-06-18 11:10:27 +0200,,,10.1109/tpami.2013.50,,,,,,,,,,,,2160-9292,,,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,8,,,1798--1828,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,,,,,,,Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.50,35,2013,
article,Benjamini1995JRSS,"The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.",,,,,,,,,"Benjamini, Yoav and Hochberg, Yosef",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-12 18:18:15 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00359246,,,Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,289--300,,,,"[Royal Statistical Society, Wiley]",,,,,,,,Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing,,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/2346101,57,1995,
article,Bergmann2012N,"Newly acquired declarative memory traces are believed to be reactivated during NonREM sleep to promote their hippocampo-neocortical transfer for long-term storage. Yet it remains a major challenge to unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in humans, we show that sleep spindles play a key role in the reactivation of memory-related neocortical representations. On separate days, participants either learned face-scene associations or performed a visuomotor control task. Spindle-coupled reactivation of brain regions representing the specific task stimuli was traced during subsequent NonREM sleep with EEG-informed fMRI. Relative to the control task, learning face-scene associations triggered a stronger combined activation of neocortical and hippocampal regions during subsequent sleep. Notably, reactivation did not only occur in temporal synchrony with spindle events but was tuned by ongoing variations in spindle amplitude. These learning-related increases in spindle-coupled neocortical activity were topographically specific because reactivation was restricted to the face- and scene-selective visual cortical areas previously activated during pre-sleep learning. Spindle-coupled hippocampal activation was stronger the better the participant had performed at prior learning. These results are in agreement with the notion that sleep spindles orchestrate the reactivation of new hippocampal--neocortical memories during sleep.",,,,,,,,,"Bergmann, Til O. and M{\""o}lle, Matthias and Diedrichs, Jens and Born, Jan and Siebner, Hartwig R.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-19 11:49:28 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.036,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,3,,,2733--2742,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Sleep spindle-related reactivation of category-specific cortical regions after learning face-scene associations,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.036,59,2012,
incollection,Bergmann2017S,"Newly acquired memories are initially hippocampus-dependent and need to undergo a process of active system consolidation, during which they are redistributed to neocortical sites for long-term storage. This process is thought to take place during phases of quiet wakefulness and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep and is presumably based on the repeated reactivation of memory engrams (patterns of hippocampo-neocortical connections) which gradually drives the establishment of respective direct cortico-cortical connections. During NREM sleep (and similarly during quiet wakefulness), control via brainstem neuromodulatory systems (in particular the cholinergic one) enables a specific kind of oscillatory activity in the thalamo-neocortico-hippocampal system that facilitates memory reactivation. NREM oscillatory activity is characterized by the neocortical slow oscillation (SO; <1 Hz), the thalamic sleep spindle (~12--15 Hz) and the hippocampal ripple (>80 Hz). The intricate interaction of SOs, spindles and ripples constitutes a set of hierarchically nested oscillations, which provides the fine-tuned temporal and spatial structure that is required to orchestrate the reactivation of memory traces and the information flow between hippocampus and neocortex. In this chapter we (i) provide a conceptual introduction to system memory consolidation, (ii) describe the neuronal mechanisms thought to underlie the generation of and interaction between SOs, spindles and ripples, (iii) discuss how these oscillations presumably mediate memory reactivation and hippocampo-neocortical cross-talk, and (iv) outline new promising approaches to directly study the ongoing reactivation of memory representations in humans.",,,,,,,,,"Bergmann, Til Ole and Staresina, Bernhard P.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL2JlcmdtYW5uMjAxN3MucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EWJlcmdtYW5uMjAxN3MucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpiZXJnbWFubjIwMTdzLnBkZgAOACQAEQBiAGUAcgBnAG0AYQBuAG4AMgAwADEANwBzAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2JlcmdtYW5uMjAxN3MucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory Consolidation,,,,,,2019-11-26 19:09:03 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1007/978-3-319-45066-7,,,"N., Axmacher and B., Rasch",,,,,,,,9783319450667,2196-6613,,,Springer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,185 -- 207,,,,Springer International Publishing,,,,,,"replay, review",,Neuronal Oscillations and Reactivation Subserving Memory Consolidation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45066-7,,2017,
article,Berlot2020E,"Despite numerous studies, there is little agreement about what brain changes accompany motor sequence learning, partly because of a general publication bias that favors novel results. We therefore decided to systematically reinvestigate proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of motor learning in a preregistered longitudinal study with four scanning sessions over 5 weeks of training. Activation decreased more for trained than untrained sequences in premotor and parietal areas, without any evidence of learning-related activation increases. Premotor and parietal regions also exhibited changes in the fine-grained, sequence-specific activation patterns early in learning, which stabilized later. No changes were observed in the primary motor cortex (M1). Overall, our study provides evidence that human motor sequence learning occurs outside of M1. Furthermore, it shows that we cannot expect to find activity increases as an indicator for learning, making subtle changes in activity patterns across weeks the most promising fMRI correlate of training-induced plasticity.",,,,,,,,,"Berlot, Eva and Popp, Nicola J and Diedrichsen, J{\""o}rn",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 12:06:44 +0200,2020-06-11 12:07:12 +0200,,,10.7554/elife.55241,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,A critical re-evaluation of fMRI signatures of motor sequence learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55241,9,2020,
article,Bermudez-Contreras2020FCN,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience are impressive. In AI, this includes the development of computer programs that can beat a grandmaster at GO or outperform human radiologists at cancer detection. A great deal of these technological developments are directly related to progress in artificial neural networks-initially inspired by our knowledge about how the brain carries out computation. In parallel, neuroscience has also experienced significant advances in understanding the brain. For example, in the field of spatial navigation, knowledge about the mechanisms and brain regions involved in neural computations of cognitive maps-an internal representation of space-recently received the Nobel Prize in medicine. Much of the recent progress in neuroscience has partly been due to the development of technology used to record from very large populations of neurons in multiple regions of the brain with exquisite temporal and spatial resolution in behaving animals. With the advent of the vast quantities of data that these techniques allow us to collect there has been an increased interest in the intersection between AI and neuroscience, many of these intersections involve using AI as a novel tool to explore and analyze these large data sets. However, given the common initial motivation point-to understand the brain-these disciplines could be more strongly linked. Currently much of this potential synergy is not being realized. We propose that spatial navigation is an excellent area in which these two disciplines can converge to help advance what we know about the brain. In this review, we first summarize progress in the neuroscience of spatial navigation and reinforcement learning. We then turn our attention to discuss how spatial navigation has been modeled using descriptive, mechanistic, and normative approaches and the use of AI in such models. Next, we discuss how AI can advance neuroscience, how neuroscience can advance AI, and the limitations of these approaches. We finally conclude by highlighting promising lines of research in which spatial navigation can be the point of intersection between neuroscience and AI and how this can contribute to the advancement of the understanding of intelligent behavior.",,,,,32848684,,,,"Bermudez-Contreras, Edgar and Clark, Benjamin J and Wilber, Aaron",,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,,,,,,,,,,2020/07/28,2021-01-27 11:54:26 +0100,2021-01-27 11:54:45 +0100,PubMed,,10.3389/fncom.2020.00063,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5188; 1662-5188,,,Front Comput Neurosci,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,,,artificial intelligence; deep learning; learning; memory; neuroscience; reinforcement learning; spatial navigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7399088/,eng,,,,,,07,,,,,,63--63,,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,,,,,,The Neuroscience of Spatial Navigation and the Relationship to Artificial Intelligence,JOUR,,32848684{$[$}pmid{$]$},PMC7399088{$[$}pmcid{$]$},https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32848684,14,2020,

article,Bi1998JN,"In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.",,,,,,,,,"Bi, Guo-qiang and Poo, Mu-ming",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-31 15:48:53 +0200,2020-03-31 15:49:23 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.18-24-10464.1998,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,24,,,10464--10472,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,"Synaptic Modifications in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons: Dependence on Spike Timing, Synaptic Strength, and Postsynaptic Cell Type",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-24-10464.1998,18,1998,

Uncovering the pervasive role of memory in decision-making challenges the way we define what memory is and what it does, suggesting that memory's primary purpose may be to guide future behavior and that storing a record of the past is just one way to do so.",,,,,,,,,"Biderman, Natalie and Bakkour, Akram and Shohamy, Daphna",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 13:55:05 +0100,2021-01-18 13:55:27 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.04.004,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6613,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,"memory, decision-making, amnesia, hippocampus, value",,,,,,,,,,,7,,,542 - 556,,,,,,,,,,,,What Are Memories For?

article,Bird2020COBS,"Episodic memory was first described as the memory system that receives and stores information about events [1]. Since then, studies of episodic memory have tended to use simple, highly controlled stimuli to probe its cognitive and neural underpinnings. By contrast, the study of `event memory' has focussed on memory function in more real-world situations, or used naturalistic stimuli such as movies as a stand-in for reality [2]. Recently there has been an explosion in studies that have combined cognitive experiments using naturalistic stimuli with neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, to shed light on how the brain underpins event memory.

article,Bliss1973JP,"1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane. 2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10--20/sec for 10--15 sec, or 100/sec for 3--4 sec. 3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells. 4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments. 5. During conditioning at 10--20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (`frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation. 6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.",,,,,,,,,"Bliss, T.

article,Blodgett1929UCPP,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the efficiency of units of practice when unaccompanied by reward. The method devised was that of running two groups of rats through the maze: an experimental group which received no reward during the first part of learning, but which suddenly had reward introduced in the latter part of learning, and a control group which received reward throughout the whole of learning. The answer to the question as to the efficiency of non-reward units of practice was sought in a comparison of the learning curve of the experimental group (both before and after the introduction of reward) with that of the control group."" Three mazes were used, two with ordinary blinds and one with blinds arranged so that the animal could go two ways as well as having as alternatives a long and a short path. ""They prevented retracings from one section of the maze to another, they were noiseless, and they caused no excitement in the animals."" There were 36 rats in each group. The results show that: ""(1) Rats run under a non-reward condition learned much more slowly than rats run under a reward condition."" ""(2) Rats previously run under a non-reward condition, when suddenly rewarded made a great improvement."" ""(3) During the non-reward period, the rats were developing a latent learning of the maze which they were able to utilize as soon as reward was introduced.""

article,Bonasia2015H,"For memory to be efficient and useful during recall, problem‐solving, and planning, retrieval must be compressed in time. Evidence from rodents suggests that neural compression during replay of spatial memories varies widely, with a range of compression ratios reported from 6:1 to 64:1. Anecdotal evidence suggests that similar compression occurs during mental navigation in humans: we recall how to get from one place to another countless times almost every day of our lives, and this recall never takes as long as physically travelling those routes would take. In this experiment we sought to determine whether this behavioural compression could be measured during mental navigation in humans (spatial memory replay), and which factors might affect the compression of such spatial memories. To this end, thirty participants mentally navigated routes between two landmarks, which varied in length and number of turns, as we measured replay times and recorded ratings of familiarity, detail, and presence. A multi‐level model was used to determine which factors were associated with variation in compression. Route length and number of turns emerged from this model as significantly correlated with compression, such that longer routes were more compressed while compression was attenuated as the number of turns in a route increased. This suggests that compression during recall may be affected by specific features of a route, especially those that may act to segment the space or event being represented.",,,,,,,,,"Bonasia, Kyra and Blommesteyn, Joseph and Moscovitch, Morris",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-09 10:30:10 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.22539,,,,,,,,,,,,1050-9631,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,1,,,9--12,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Memory and navigation: Compression of space varies with route length and turns,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22539,26,2015,
article,Bonetti2020B,"Information encoding has received a wide neuroscientific attention, but the underlying rapid spatiotemporal brain dynamics remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the rapid brain mechanisms for encoding and prediction of sounds forming a complex temporal sequence. Specifically, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the brain activity of 68 participants while they listened to a highly structured musical prelude. Advanced analysis of the phase synchronisation and graph theoretical measures showed the rapid transition of brain activity from primary auditory cortex to higher order association areas including insula and superior temporal pole within a whole-brain network, occurring during the first 220 ms of the encoding process. We discovered individual differences, revealing the rapid unfolding of brain network dynamics responsible for the processing of the current sounds and the prediction of the forthcoming events of the sequence. This provides a first glimpse of the general mechanisms underlying pattern encoding in the human brain.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Bonetti, Leonardo and Brattico, Elvira and Carlomagno, Francesco and Donati, Giulia and Cabral, Joana and Haumann, Niels T. and Deco, Gustavo and Vuust, Peter and Kringelbach, Morten L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 09:05:14 +0100,2020-12-14 09:05:42 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.11.421669,,,,,2020.12.11.421669,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/11/2020.12.11.421669.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Rapid encoding of temporal sequences discovered in brain dynamics,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/11/2020.12.11.421669,,2020,

article,Bongioanni2021N,"Neural mechanisms that mediate the ability to make value-guided decisions have received substantial attention in humans and animals1--6. Experiments in animals typically involve long training periods. By contrast, choices in the real world often need to be made between new options spontaneously. It is therefore possible that the neural mechanisms targeted in animal studies differ from those required for new decisions, which are typical of human imaging studies. Here we show that the primate medial frontal cortex (MFC)7 is involved in making new inferential choices when the options have not been previously experienced. Macaques spontaneously inferred the values of new options via similarities with the component parts of previously encountered options.

Multidimensional representations of options in the MFC used a coding scheme resembling that of grid cells, which is well known in spatial navigation8,9, to integrate dimensions in this non-physical space10 during novel decision-making.

article,Bornstein2017NN,"How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free reinforcement learning; however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice and, as such, has broad implications for the study of decisions.",,,,,,,,,"Bornstein, Aaron M and Norman, Kenneth A",,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,,,,,,,,,2017/07/01,,2020-10-30 16:50:12 +0100,2020-10-30 16:50:40 +0100,,,10.1038/nn.4573,,,,,,,,,Bornstein2017,,1546-1726,,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,997--1003,,,,,,,,,,,,Reinstated episodic context guides sampling-based decisions for reward,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4573,20,2017,
article,Bornstein2013PCB,"How do we use our memories of the past to guide decisions we've never had to make before? Although extensive work describes how the brain learns to repeat rewarded actions, decisions can also be influenced by associations between stimuli or events not directly involving reward --- such as when planning routes using a cognitive map or chess moves using predicted countermoves --- and these sorts of associations are critical when deciding among novel options. This process is known as model-based decision making. While the learning of environmental relations that might support model-based decisions is well studied, and separately this sort of information has been inferred to impact decisions, there is little evidence concerning the full cycle by which such associations are acquired and drive choices. Of particular interest is whether decisions are directly supported by the same mnemonic systems characterized for relational learning more generally, or instead rely on other, specialized representations. Here, building on our previous work, which isolated dual representations underlying sequential predictive learning, we directly demonstrate that one such representation, encoded by the hippocampal memory system and adjacent cortical structures, supports goal-directed decisions. Using interleaved learning and decision tasks, we monitor predictive learning directly and also trace its influence on decisions for reward. We quantitatively compare the learning processes underlying multiple behavioral and fMRI observables using computational model fits. Across both tasks, a quantitatively consistent learning process explains reaction times, choices, and both expectation- and surprise-related neural activity. The same hippocampal and ventral stream regions engaged in anticipating stimuli during learning are also engaged in proportion to the difficulty of decisions. These results support a role for predictive associations learned by the hippocampal memory system to be recalled during choice formation.",,,,,,,,,"Bornstein, Aaron M. and Daw, Nathaniel D.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAeLi4vcGFwZXJzL2Jvcm5zdGVpbjIwMTNwY2IucGRmTxEBfAAAAAABfAACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////FGJvcm5zdGVpbjIwMTNwY2IucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBDLzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpib3Juc3RlaW4yMDEzcGNiLnBkZgAADgAqABQAYgBvAHIAbgBzAHQAZQBpAG4AMgAwADEAMwBwAGMAYgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASAEFVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9ib3Juc3RlaW4yMDEzcGNiLnBkZgAAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQARQAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHF,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 11:48:08 +0200,2020-04-15 11:48:29 +0200,,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003387,,,"Behrens, TimEditor",,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,PLoS Computational Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,12,,,e1003387,,,,Public Library of Science (PLoS),,,,,,,,Cortical and Hippocampal Correlates of Deliberation during Model-Based Decisions for Rewards in Humans,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003387,9,2013,

In a second experiment, we bias this sampling process by incidentally reminding participants of individual past decisions. The next decision after a reminder shows a strong influence of the action taken and value received on the reminded trial.

article,Bostock1991H,"Understanding the empirical rules that regulate alterations of hippocampal firing fields will enhance our understanding of hippocampal function. The current study sought to extend previous research in this area by examining the effect of substituting a new stimulus for a familiar stimulus in a familiar environment. Hippocampal place cells were recorded while rats chased food pellets scattered onto the floor of a cylindrical apparatus with a white cue card affixed to the apparatus wall. Once a place cell had been recorded in the presence of the white card, the white card was replaced by a black card of the same size and shape. The place cell was then recorded in the presence of the black card. Thirty-six cells were recorded using this procedure. All cells had stable firing fields in the presence of the white card. Both the white and black cards had stimulus control over place cell firing; generally, rotation of either card caused an equal rotation of the firing fields present. When the black card was substituted for the white card, place cells showed time-variant changes in their spatial firing patterns. The change was such that the spatial firing patterns of the majority of place cells were similar in the presence of the white and black cards during initial black card exposures. During subsequent presentations of the black card, the spatial firing patterns associated with the 2 cards became distinct from each other. Once the differentiation of firing patterns had occurred in a given rat, all place cells subsequently recorded from that rat had different firing patterns in the presence of the white and black cards. The findings are discussed relative to sensory-, motor-, attentional-, and learning-related interpretations of hippocampal function. It is argued that the time-variant alteration of place cell firing fields observed following exposure to a novel stimulus in this study reflects an experience-dependent modification of place cell firing patterns.",,,,,,,,,"Bostock, Elizabeth and Muller, Robert U. and Kubie, John L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-11 17:04:54 +0100,2020-12-11 17:05:37 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.450010207,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.450010207,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"hippocampal place cells, cognitive maps, spatial representation, hippocampal plasticity",,,,,,,,,,,2,,,193-205,,,,,,,,,,,,Experience-dependent modifications of hippocampal place cell firing,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.450010207,1,1991,

article,Botvinick2009C,"Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure---the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems.

article,Botvinik-Nezer2019B,"Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. To assess the impact of this flexibility on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, the same dataset was independently analyzed by 70 teams, testing nine ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytic approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyze the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in hypothesis test results, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of their analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Importantly, meta-analytic approaches that aggregated information across teams yielded significant consensus in activated regions across teams. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset.

article,Botvinik-Nezer2020N,"Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2--5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging.

article,Bouchacourt2020E,"Depending on environmental demands, humans can learn and exploit multiple concurrent sets of stimulus-response associations. Mechanisms underlying the learning of such task-sets remain unknown. Here we investigate the hypothesis that task-set learning relies on unsupervised chunking of stimulus-response associations that occur in temporal proximity. We examine behavioral and neural data from a task-set learning experiment using a network model. We first show that task-set learning can be achieved provided the timescale of chunking is slower than the timescale of stimulus-response learning. Fitting the model to behavioral data on a subject-by-subject basis confirmed this expectation and led to specific predictions linking chunking and task-set retrieval that were borne out by behavioral performance and reaction times. Comparing the model activity with BOLD signal allowed us to identify neural correlates of task-set retrieval in a functional network involving ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortex, with the dorsal system preferentially engaged when retrievals are used to improve performance.",,,,,,,,journal,"Bouchacourt, Flora and Palminteri, Stefano and Koechlin, Etienne and Ostojic, Srdjan",,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,,,,,,,eLife 2020;9:e50469,,,,2020-10-29 14:56:43 +0100,2020-10-29 14:56:58 +0100,,,10.7554/eLife.50469,,,"van Rossum, Mark CW and Shinn-Cunningham, Barbara G",,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,"computational neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, neural networks",,,,,,,,mar,,,,,,e50469,,,2020-03-09,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,Temporal chunking as a mechanism for unsupervised learning of task-sets,,,,,https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50469,9,2020,
article,Bouret2005TN,"Unraveling the functional role of neuromodulatory systems has been a major challenge for cognitive neuroscience, giving rise to theories ranging from a simple role in vigilance to complex models concerning decision making, prediction errors or unexpected uncertainty. A new, simplified and overarching theory of noradrenaline function is inspired by an invertebrate model: neuromodulators in crustacea abruptly interrupt activity in neural networks and reorganize the elements into new functional networks determining the behavioral output. Analogously in mammals, phasic activation of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus in time with cognitive shifts could provoke or facilitate dynamic reorganization of target neural networks, permitting rapid behavioral adaptation to changing environmental imperatives. Detailed analysis and discussion of extensive electrophysiological data from the locus coeruleus of rats and monkeys in controlled behavioral situations is provided here to support this view. This simplified `new look' at locus coeruleus noradrenaline function redirects the challenge of understanding neuromodulatory systems towards their target networks, particularly to the dynamics of their interactions and how they organize adaptive behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Bouret, Sebastien and Sara, Susan J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-13 14:19:00 +0100,2021-01-13 14:19:17 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2005.09.002,,,,,,,,,,,,0166-2236,,,Trends in Neurosciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,,,574 - 582,,,,,,,,,,,,Network reset: a simplified overarching theory of locus coeruleus noradrenaline function,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223605002432,28,2005,
article,Bower2005JN,"Learning sequences of events (e.g., a-b-c) is conceptually a simple problem that can be solved using asymmetrically linked cell assemblies [e.g., {\textquotedblleft}phase sequences{\textquotedblright} (Hebb, 1949)], provided that the elements of the sequence are unique. When elements repeat within the sequence, however (e.g., a-b-c-d-b-e), the same element belongs to two separate {\textquotedblleft}contexts,{\textquotedblright} and a more complex sequence encoding mechanism is required to differentiate between the two contexts. Some neural structure must form sequential-context-dependent, or {\textquotedblleft}differential,{\textquotedblright} representations of the two contexts (i.e., b as an element of {\textquotedblleft}a-b-c{\textquotedblright} as opposed to {\textquotedblleft}d-b-e{\textquotedblright}) to allow the correct choice to be made after the repeated element. To investigate the possible role of hippocampus in complex sequence encoding, rats were trained to remember repeated-location sequences under three conditions: (1) reward was given at each location; (2) during training, moveable barriers were placed at the entry and exit of the repeated segment to direct the rat and were removed once the sequence was learned; and (3) reward was withheld at the entry and exit of the repeated segment. In the first condition, hippocampal ensemble activity did not differentiate the sequential context of the repeated segment, indicating that complex sequences with repeated segments can be learned without differential encoding within the hippocampus. Differential hippocampal encoding was observed, however, under the latter two conditions, suggesting that long-term memory for discriminative cues present only during training, working memory of the most recently visited reinforcement sites, or anticipation of the subsequent reinforcement site can separate hippocampal activity patterns at the same location.",,,,,,,,,"Bower, Mark R. and Euston, David R. and McNaughton, Bruce L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-21 11:45:46 +0100,2020-12-21 11:46:02 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2901-04.2005,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/6/1313.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,1313--1323,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Sequential-Context-Dependent Hippocampal Activity Is Not Necessary to Learn Sequences with Repeated Elements,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/6/1313,25,2005,

Second, responses to long-duration stimuli can be predicted from responses to shorter duration stimuli. Third, the noise in the fMRI data is independent of stimulus contrast and temporal period. Although these tests can not prove the correctness of the linear transform model, they might have been used to reject the model.

article,Bradfield2020NBR,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been proposed to function as a cognitive map of task space: a mental model of the steps involved in a task. This idea has proven popular because it provides a cohesive explanation for a number of disparate findings regarding the OFC's role in a broad array of tasks. Concurrently, evidence has begun to reveal the functional heterogeneity of OFC subregions, particularly the medial and lateral OFC. How these subregions uniquely contribute to the OFC's role as a cognitive map of task space, however, has not been explored. Here we propose that, in rodents, the lateral OFC represents the agent's initial position within that task map (i.e. initial state), determining which actions are available as a consequence of that position, whereas the medial OFC represents the agent's future position within the task map (i.e. terminal state), influencing which actions are selected to achieve that position.

article,Brady2008PNAS,"One of the major lessons of memory research has been that human memory is fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92%, 88%, and 87%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images.

article,Brady2013JEPG,"Are real-world objects represented as bound units? Although a great deal of research has examined binding between the feature dimensions of simple shapes, little work has examined whether the featural properties of real-world objects are stored in a single unitary object representation. In a first experiment, we found that information about an object's color is forgotten more rapidly than the information about an object's state (e.g., open, closed), suggesting that observers do not forget objects as entirely bound units. In a second and third experiment, we examined whether state and exemplar information are forgotten separately or together. If these properties are forgotten separately, the probability of getting one feature correct should be independent of whether the other feature was correct. We found that after a short delay, observers frequently remember both state and exemplar information about the same objects, but after a longer delay, memory for the two properties becomes independent. This indicates that information about object state and exemplar are forgotten separately over time. We thus conclude that real-world objects are not represented in a single unitary representation in visual memory.",,,,,,,,,"Brady, Timothy F. and Konkle, Talia and Alvarez, George A. and Oliva, Aude",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 14:57:05 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1037/a0029649,,,,,,,,,,,,0096-3445,,,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,791--808,,,,American Psychological Association (APA),,,,,,koenigsberg,,Real-world objects are not represented as bound units: Independent forgetting of different object details from visual memory.,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0029649,142,2013,
article,Brady2013PS,"Visual long-term memory can store thousands of objects with surprising visual detail, but just how detailed are these representations, and how can one quantify this fidelity? Using the property of color as a case study, we estimated the precision of visual information in long-term memory, and compared this with the precision of the same information in working memory. Observers were shown real-world objects in random colors and were asked to recall the colors after a delay. We quantified two parameters of performance: the variability of internal representations of color (fidelity) and the probability of forgetting an object's color altogether. Surprisingly, the fidelity of color information in long-term memory was comparable to the asymptotic precision of working memory.

article,Braun2018NC,"Many decisions are based on an internal model of the world. Yet, how such a model is constructed from experience and represented in memory remains unknown. We test the hypothesis that reward shapes memory for sequences of events by retroactively prioritizing memory for objects as a function of their distance from reward. Human participants encountered neutral objects while exploring a series of mazes for reward. Across six data sets, we find that reward systematically modulates memory for neutral objects, retroactively prioritizing memory for objects closest to the reward. This effect of reward on memory emerges only after a 24-hour delay and is stronger for mazes followed by a longer rest interval, suggesting a role for post-reward replay and overnight consolidation, as predicted by neurobiological data in animals. These findings demonstrate that reward retroactively prioritizes memory along a sequential gradient, consistent with the role of memory in supporting adaptive decision-making.",,,,,,,,,"Braun, Erin Kendall and Wimmer, G.

article,Bridges2020P,"Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioural experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime{\textregistered}, NBS Presentation{\textregistered}, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance.
Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that Mac OS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages.
Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on a number of browser configurations. For response times (using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between operating systems and browsers, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result.
The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task.

We assessed microstructural plasticity via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging as well as functional brain activity in an object--location learning task. We detected neocortical plasticity as early as 1 hour after learning and found that it was learning specific, enabled correct recall, and overlapped with memory-related functional activity.

article,Bruckner2020P,"Across the lifespan, humans rely on the ability to learn from new experiences to adapt to uncertain and changing environments. Here we investigated age-related differences in the reliance on default-belief settings during learning in these environments. We collected behavioral data with a predictive-inference task in children, adolescents as well as younger and older adults. Using a Bayesian belief-updating model, we first showed that age-related learning differences might be due to a reduced ability to adjust learning according to dissociable normative factors. The results revealed a reduced consideration of uncertainty in older adults and increased perseveration in both children and older adults. Simulations indicated that interventions to reduce perseveration might lead to more similar performance levels between the age groups. In a follow-up experiment, we found that one such intervention which randomly distorted participants' initial predictions strongly reduced perseveration, but led to increased performance differences. This counter-intuitive effect resulted from an environmental control of learning in children and older adults through random information from the intervention to reduce perseveration. Across the two experiments, our findings show that age-related learning impairments can be explained with insufficient updating from a default belief. In stable environments, this results in perseverative behavior, while in the presence of random environmental information, it leads to environmental control. We formalized the emergence of these belief-updating behaviors with a model that updated beliefs only to an acceptable level of plausibility, suggesting that children and older adults are more quickly satisfied to report beliefs that reflect their default than younger adults. This model not only accounted for our own findings but might also provide a new perspective on a wide variety of previous findings in the developmental and aging literature.",,,,,,,,,"Bruckner, Rasmus and Nassar, Matthew R. and Li, Shu-Chen and Eppinger, Ben",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-04 08:57:04 +0200,2020-08-04 08:57:41 +0200,,,10.31234/osf.io/nh9bq,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,,,,,Center for Open Science,,,,,,,,Default beliefs guide learning under uncertainty in children and older adults,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/nh9bq,,2020,

Here we investigated relational knowledge during spatial navigation as multiscale predictive representations in the brain. We hypothesized that these representations are organized at multiple scales along posterior to anterior hierarchies in prefrontal and hippocampal regions. To test this, we conducted model based representational similarity analyses of neuroimaging data measured during virtual reality navigation of familiar and unfamiliar paths with realistically long distances. We tested the pattern similarity of each point, along each navigational path, to a weighted sum of its successor points within different temporal horizons. Predictive similarity was significantly higher for familiar paths. Overall, anterior PFC showed predictive horizons at the largest scales (~875m) and posterior hippocampus at the lowest (~25m), while the anterior hippocampus (~175m), prepolar PFC, and orbitofrontal regions (~350m) were in between. These findings support the idea that predictive representations are maintained at higher scales of abstraction in the anterior PFC, and unfolded at lower scales by prepolar PFC and hippocampal regions. This representational hierarchy can support generalization, hierarchical planning, and subgoals at multiple scales.",,,,,,,,,"Brunec, Iva K and Momennejad, Ida",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL2JydW5lYzIwMTliLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w9icnVuZWMyMDE5Yi5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6YnJ1bmVjMjAxOWIucGRmAA4AIAAPAGIAcgB1AG4AZQBjADIAMAAxADkAYgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9icnVuZWMyMDE5Yi5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-01 09:04:22 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/786434,,,,,786434,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/09/30/786434.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Predictive Representations in Hippocampal and Prefrontal Hierarchies,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/09/30/786434,,2019,
article,Brunec2018TCS,"Efficient navigation from one place to another is facilitated by the ability to use spatial boundaries to segment routes into their component parts. Similarly, memory for individual episodes relies on the ability to use shifts in spatiotemporal contexts to segment the ongoing stream of experience. The segmentation of experiences in spatial and episodic domains may therefore share neural underpinnings, manifesting in similar behavioral phenomena and cognitive biases. Here, we review evidence for such shared mechanisms, focusing on the key role of boundaries in spatial and episodic memory. We propose that a fundamental event boundary detection mechanism enables navigation in both the spatial and episodic domains, and serves to form cohesive representations that can be used to predict and guide future behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Brunec, Iva K. and Moscovitch, Morris and Barense, Morgan D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-16 18:08:44 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.tics.2018.03.013,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6613,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,7,,,637--650,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Boundaries Shape Cognitive Representations of Spaces and Events,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2018.03.013,22,2018,

article,Buckner2010ARP,"Traditionally, the hippocampal system has been studied in relation to the goal of retrieving memories about the past. Recent work in humans and rodents suggests that the hippocampal system may be better understood as a system that facilitates predictions about upcoming events. The hippocampus and associated cortical structures are active when people envision future events, and damage that includes the hippocampal region impairs this ability. In rats, hippocampal ensembles preplay and replay event sequences in the absence of overt behavior. If strung together in novel combinations, these sequences could provide the neural building blocks for simulating upcoming events during decision-making, planning, and when imagining novel scenarios. Moreover, in both humans and rodents, the hippocampal system is spontaneously active during task-free epochs and sleep, further suggesting that the system may use idle moments to derive new representations that set the context for future behaviors.

These abilities emerge at a similar age and share a common functional anatomy that includes frontal and medial temporal systems that are traditionally associated with planning, episodic memory and default (passive) cognitive states.

In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons.

article,Bugatus2017N,"A central question in neuroscience is how cognitive tasks affect category representations across the human brain. Regions in lateral occipito-temporal cortex (LOTC), ventral temporal cortex (VTC), and ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLFPC) constitute the extended ``what'' pathway, which is considered instrumental for visual category processing. However, it is unknown (1) whether distributed responses across LOTC, VTC, and VLPFC explicitly represent category, task, or some combination of both, and (2) in what way representations across these subdivisions of the extended `what' pathway may differ. To fill these gaps in knowledge, we scanned 12 participants using fMRI to test the effect of category and task on distributed responses across LOTC, VTC, and VLPFC. Results reveal that task and category modulate responses in both high-level visual regions, as well as prefrontal cortex. However, we found fundamentally different types of representations across the brain. Distributed responses in high-level visual regions are more strongly driven by category than task, and exhibit task-independent category representations. In contrast, distributed responses in prefrontal cortex are more strongly driven by task than category, and contain task-dependent category representations. Together, these findings of differential representations across the brain support a new idea that LOTC and VTC maintain stable category representations allowing efficient processing of visual information, while prefrontal cortex contains flexible representations in which category information may emerge only when relevant to the task.",,,,,,,,,"Bugatus, Lior and Weiner, Kevin S. and Grill-Spector, Kalanit",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 14:43:02 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.062,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,Object processing; Attention; Working memory; Categorization; Prefrontal cortex; Occipito-temporal cortex,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,437--449,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Task alters category representations in prefrontal but not high-level visual cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.062,155,2017,
article,Buhry2011NP,"Sequential activation of neurons that occurs during ``offline'' states, such as sleep or awake rest, is correlated with neural sequences recorded during preceding exploration phases. This so-called reactivation, or replay, has been observed in a number of different brain regions such as the striatum, prefrontal cortex, primary visual cortex and, most prominently, the hippocampus. Reactivation largely co-occurs together with hippocampal sharp-waves/ripples, brief high-frequency bursts in the local field potential. Here, we first review the mounting evidence for the hypothesis that reactivation is the neural mechanism for memory consolidation during sleep. We then discuss recent results that suggest that offline sequential activity in the waking state might not be simple repetitions of previously experienced sequences. Some offline sequential activity occurs before animals are exposed to a novel environment for the first time, and some sequences activated offline correspond to trajectories never experienced by the animal. We propose a conceptual framework for the dynamics of offline sequential activity that can parsimoniously describe a broad spectrum of experimental results.

Empirical evidence suggests that this ``vector navigation'' relies on an internal representation of space provided by the hippocampal formation. The periodic spatial firing patterns of grid cells in the hippocampal formation offer a compact combinatorial code for location within large-scale space. Here, we consider the computational problem of how to determine the vector between start and goal locations encoded by the firing of grid cells when this vector may be much longer than the largest grid scale. First, we present an algorithmic solution to the problem, inspired by the Fourier shift theorem. Second, we describe several potential neural network implementations of this solution that combine efficiency of search and biological plausibility.

article,Busquets-Garcia2018N,"By priming brain circuits, associations between low-salience stimuli often guide future behavioral choices through a process known as mediated or inferred learning. However, the precise neurobiological mechanisms of these incidental associations are largely unknown.

Deletion and re-expression of CB1R in hippocampal GABAergic neurons abolishes and rescues mediated learning, respectively. Interestingly, paired presentations of low-salience sensory cues induce a specific protein synthesis-dependent enhancement of hippocampal CB1R expression and facilitate long-term synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. CB1R blockade or chemogenetic manipulations of hippocampal GABAergic neurons upon preconditioning affect incidental associations, as revealed by impaired mediated learning. Thus, CB1R-dependent control of inhibitory hippocampal neurotransmission mediates incidental associations, allowing future associative inference, a fundamental process for everyday life, which is altered in major neuropsychiatric diseases.",,,,,,,,,"Busquets-Garcia, Arnau and {Oliveira da Cruz}, Jos{\'e} F. and Terral, Geoffrey and {Pagano Zottola}, Antonio C. and Soria-G{\'o}mez, Edgar and Contini, Andrea and Martin, Hugo and Redon, Bastien and Varilh, Marjorie and Ioannidou, Christina and Drago, Filippo and Massa, Federico and Fioramonti, Xavier and Trifilieff, Pierre and Ferreira, Guillaume and Marsicano, Giovanni",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 13:45:09 +0100,2020-12-14 15:41:23 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.08.014,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,"incidental learning, mediated learning, higher-order associations, hippocampus, GABA, CB1, endocannabinoids, Western immunoblotting, electrophysiology (LTP, I-LTD)",,,,,,,,,,,6,,,1247 - 1259.e7,,,,,,,,,,statistical learning,,Hippocampal {CB1} Receptors Control Incidental Associations,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318306871,99,2018,
article,Butler2008B,"Complaints of memory difficulties are common among patients with epilepsy, particularly with temporal lobe epilepsy where memory-related brain structures are directly involved by seizure activity. However, the reason for these complaints is often unclear and patients frequently perform normally on standard neuropsychological tests of memory. In this article, we review the literature on three recently described and interrelated forms of memory impairment associated with epilepsy: (i) transient epileptic amnesia, in which the sole or main manifestation of seizures is recurrent episodes of amnesia; (ii) accelerated long-term forgetting, in which newly acquired memories fade over days to weeks and (iii) remote memory impairment, in which there is loss of memories for personal or public facts or events from the distant past. Accelerated long-term forgetting and remote memory impairment are common amongst patients with transient epileptic amnesia, but have been reported in other forms of epilepsy. Their presence goes undetected by standard memory tests and yet they can have a profound impact on patients' lives. They pose challenges to current theoretical models of memory. We discuss the evidence for each of these phenomena, as well as their possible pathophysiological bases, methodological difficulties in their investigation and their theoretical implications.",,,,,,,,,"Butler, C.

article,Butler2019S,"Recent findings suggest a more complex role of grid cells in the brain than simply coding for space. The grid map in the entorhinal cortex, which is responsible for encoding spatial information, is not as rigid as originally thought and can be distorted by environmental modifications (see the Perspective by Quian Quiroga). Butler et al. compared grid cell coding during a free-foraging task and a spatial memory task in rats. They discovered that entorhinal spatial maps restructure to incorporate the location of a learned reward. Boccara et al. tested the influence of behaviorally relevant information on the cognitive map that emerges from grid cell firing in the rat medial entorhinal cortex. They found that grid cells participate in neural coding of the goal locality, not the whole environment.Science, this issue p. 1447, p. 1443; see also p. 1388Ethologically relevant navigational strategies often incorporate remembered reward locations. Although neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a maplike representation of the external spatial world, whether this map integrates information regarding learned reward locations remains unknown. We compared entorhinal coding in rats during a free-foraging task and a spatial memory task. Entorhinal spatial maps restructured to incorporate a learned reward location, which in turn improved positional decoding near this location.

article,Buzsaki1989N,"Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities, while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition. An overview of the experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency, and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold) suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets, (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst, and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts (initiator cells). Based on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes) is detrimental to memory trace formation.",,,,,,,,,"Buzs{\'a}ki, G.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 17:12:48 +0200,2020-04-15 17:15:50 +0200,,,10.1016/0306-4522(89)90423-5,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4522,,,Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,3,,,551--570,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Two-stage model of memory trace formation: A role for ``noisy'' brain states,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(89)90423-5,31,1989,
article,Buzsaki1986BR,"This study investigated the spatial distribution and cellular-synaptic generation of hippocampal sharp waves (SPW) in the dorsal hippocampus of the awake rat. Depth analyses of SPWs were performed by stepping the recording electrode in 82.5 μm increments. SPWs were present during slow wave sleep, awake immobility, drinking, grooming and eating (0.01--2/s). The largest negative SPWs were recorded from the middle part of the stratum radiatum of CA1, the stratum lucidum of CA3, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and from layer I of the subiculum, in that order. The polarity of the SPWs was positive in layers II--IV of the subiculum, in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3, and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The electrical gradients across the null zones of the field SPWs were as large as 8--14 mV/mm. SPWs were associated with population bursts of pyramidal cells and increased discharges of interneurons and granule cells. During the SPW the excitability of granule cells and pyramidal cells to afferent volleys increased considerably. Picrotoxin and atropine and aspiration lesion of the fimbria-fornix increased either the amplitude or the frequency of SPWs. Diazepam and Nembutal could completely abolish SPWs. It is suggested that: (1) hippocampal SPWs are triggered by a population burst of CA3 pyramidal cells as a result of temporary disinhibition from afferent control; and (2) field SPWs represent summed extracellular PSPs of CA1 and subicular pyramidal cells, and dentate granular cells induced by the Schaffer collaterals and the associational fibers of hilar cells, respectively.

article,Buzsaki1998JSR,"In the awake brain, information about the external world reaches the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex, whereas during sleep the direction of information flow is reversed: population bursts initiated in the hippocampus invade the neocortex. We suggest that neocortico‐hippocampal transfer of information and the modification process in neocortical circuitries by the hippocampal output take place in a temporally discontinuous manner associated with the wake‐sleep cycle. Loading the hippocampus with neocortical information may happen fast during the aroused state of the hippocampus associated with theta/gamma oscillations. On the other hand, transfer of the stored representations to neocortical areas is carried by discrete quanta of co‐operative neuronal bursts (called sharp wave bursts) initiated in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep. The spatio‐temporal participation of principal cells in sharp waves is determined by experience‐induced changes in the CA3 recurrent collateral matrix. The co‐operative, converging pre‐synaptic activity can induce localized fast spikes and associated calcium influx in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, a necessary condition for the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, the subcortical effects of hippocampal sharp wave bursts may be critical in the release of various hormones which, in turn, may affect synaptic plasticity.

article,Buzsaki2015H,"Sharp wave ripples (SPW‐Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW‐Rs occur during ``off‐line'' states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non‐REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW‐induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW‐Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW‐Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW‐Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre‐existing information are combined during SPW‐R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW‐Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW‐Rs leads to their pathological conversion, ``p‐ripples,'' which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease.

book,Buzsaki2019OUP,"Is there a right way to study how the brain works? Following the empiricist's tradition, the most common approach involves the study of neural reactions to stimuli presented by an experimenter. This 'outside-in' method fueled a generation of brain research and now must confront hidden assumptions about causation and concepts that may not hold neatly for systems that act and react.

Gy{\""o}rgy Buzs{\'a}ki's The Brain from Inside Out examines why the outside-in framework for understanding brain function has become stagnant and points to new directions for understanding neural function. Building upon the success of 2011's Rhythms of the Brain, Professor Buzs{\'a}ki presents the brain as a foretelling device that interacts with its environment through action and the examination of action's consequence. Consider that our brains are initially filled with nonsense patterns, all of which are gibberish until grounded by action-based interactions. By matching these nonsense ""words"" to the outcomes of action, they acquire meaning. Once its circuits are ""calibrated"" by action and experience, the brain can disengage from its sensors and actuators, and examine ""what happens if"" scenarios by peeking into its own computation, a process that we refer to as cognition.
The Brain from Inside Out explains why our brain is not an information-absorbing coding device, as it is often portrayed, but a venture-seeking explorer constantly controlling the body to test hypotheses.

article,Buzsaki1992S,"Pyramidal cells in the CA1 hippocampal region displayed transient network oscillations (200 hertz) during behavioral immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow-wave sleep. Simultaneous, multisite recordings revealed temporal and spatial coherence of neuronal activity during population oscillations.

Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same.

First, we replicated the original in-lab findings, demonstrating generalizability to subjects learning the task in their daily living environment (N = 389). Second, we show that offline improvements during rest are equivalent when significantly shortening practice period duration, thus confirming that they are not a result of recovery from performance fatigue (N = 118). Third, retroactive interference immediately after each practice period reduced the learning rate relative to interference after passage of time (N = 373), indicating stabilization of the motor memory at a microscale of several seconds.

article,Bonstrup2019CB,"The brain strengthens memories through consolidation, defined as resistance to interference (stabilization) or performance improvements between the end of a practice session and the beginning of the next (offline gains) [1]. Typically, consolidation has been measured hours or days after the completion of training [2], but the same concept may apply to periods of rest that occur interspersed in a series of practice bouts within the same session. Here, we took an unprecedented close look at the within-seconds time course of early human procedural learning over alternating short periods of practice and rest that constitute a typical online training session. We found that performance did not markedly change over short periods of practice. On the other hand, performance improvements in between practice periods, when subjects were at rest, were significant and accounted for early procedural learning. These offline improvements were more prominent in early training trials when the learning curve was steep and no performance decrements during preceding practice periods were present. At the neural level, simultaneous magnetoencephalographic recordings showed an anatomically defined signature of this phenomenon. Beta-band brain oscillatory activity in a predominantly contralateral frontoparietal network predicted rest-period performance improvements. Consistent with its role in sensorimotor engagement [3], modulation of beta activity may reflect replay of task processes during rest periods. We report a rapid form of offline consolidation that substantially contributes to early skill learning and may extend the concept of consolidation to a time scale in the order of seconds, rather than the hours or days traditionally accepted.",,,,,,,,,"B{\""o}nstrup, Marlene and Iturrate, I{\~n}aki and Thompson, Ryan and Cruciani, Gabriel and Censor, Nitzan and Cohen, Leonardo G.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 12:02:29 +0100,2020-10-27 12:02:55 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.049,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,"consolidation, human motor learning, skill learning, procedural memory, offline learning, magnetoencephalography, beta activity, reactivation, replay",,,,,,,,,,,8,,,1346 - 1351.e4,,,,,,,,,,,,A Rapid Form of Offline Consolidation in Skill Learning,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219302192,29,2019,
article,Cai2019PCB,"The activity of neural populations in the brains of humans and animals can exhibit vastly different spatial patterns when faced with different tasks or environmental stimuli. The degrees of similarity between these neural activity patterns in response to different events are used to characterize the representational structure of cognitive states in a neural population. The dominant methods of investigating this similarity structure first estimate neural activity patterns from noisy neural imaging data using linear regression, and then examine the similarity between the estimated patterns. Here, we show that this approach introduces spurious bias structure in the resulting similarity matrix, in particular when applied to fMRI data. This problem is especially severe when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and in cases where experimental conditions cannot be fully randomized in a task. We propose Bayesian Representational Similarity Analysis (BRSA), an alternative method for computing representational similarity, in which we treat the covariance structure of neural activity patterns as a hyper-parameter in a generative model of the neural data. By marginalizing over the unknown activity patterns, we can directly estimate this covariance structure from imaging data. This method offers significant reductions in bias and allows estimation of neural representational similarity with previously unattained levels of precision at low signal-to-noise ratio, without losing the possibility of deriving an interpretable distance measure from the estimated similarity. The method is closely related to Pattern Component Model (PCM), but instead of modeling the estimated neural patterns as in PCM, BRSA models the imaging data directly and is suited for analyzing data in which the order of task conditions is not fully counterbalanced. The probabilistic framework allows for jointly analyzing data from a group of participants. The method can also simultaneously estimate a signal-to-noise ratio map that shows where the learned representational structure is supported more strongly. Both this map and the learned covariance matrix can be used as a structured prior for maximum a posteriori estimation of neural activity patterns, which can be further used for fMRI decoding. Our method therefore paves the way towards a more unified and principled analysis of neural representations underlying fMRI signals.

We examined the content of awake replay events following motivational shifts between hunger and thirst.

TDA represents the shape of the data (suitably defined) in a combinatorial fashion. Methods for measuring shape have been developed within mathematics, providing a toolkit referred to as homology. In working with data, one can use this kind of modelling to obtain an understanding of the overall structure of the data set.

article,Carp2012FN,"How likely are published findings in the functional neuroimaging literature to be false? According to a recent mathematical model, the potential for false positives increases with the flexibility of analysis methods. Functional MRI (fMRI) experiments can be analyzed using a large number of commonly used tools, with little consensus on how, when, or whether to apply each one. This situation may lead to substantial variability in analysis outcomes. Thus, the present study sought to estimate the flexibility of neuroimaging analysis by submitting a single event-related fMRI experiment to a large number of unique analysis procedures. Ten analysis steps for which multiple strategies appear in the literature were identified, and two to four strategies were enumerated for each step. Considering all possible combinations of these strategies yielded 6,912 unique analysis pipelines. Activation maps from each pipeline were corrected for multiple comparisons using five thresholding approaches, yielding 34,560 significance maps. While some outcomes were relatively consistent across pipelines, others showed substantial methods-related variability in activation strength, location, and extent. Some analysis decisions contributed to this variability more than others, and different decisions were associated with distinct patterns of variability across the brain. Qualitative outcomes also varied with analysis parameters: many contrasts yielded significant activation under some pipelines but not others. Altogether, these results reveal considerable flexibility in the analysis of fMRI experiments. This observation, when combined with mathematical simulations linking analytic flexibility with elevated false positive rates, suggests that false positive results may be more prevalent than expected in the literature. This risk of inflated false positive rates may be mitigated by constraining the flexibility of analytic choices or by abstaining from selective analysis reporting.",,,,,,,,,"Carp, Joshua",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAYLi4vcGFwZXJzL2NhcnAyMDEyZm4ucGRmTxEBZAAAAAABZAACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////DmNhcnAyMDEyZm4ucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgA9LzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpjYXJwMjAxMmZuLnBkZgAADgAeAA4AYwBhAHIAcAAyADAAMQAyAGYAbgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADtVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9jYXJwMjAxMmZuLnBkZgAAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAPwAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGn,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-16 12:37:14 +0100,2020-11-16 12:38:01 +0100,,,10.3389/fnins.2012.00149,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-453X,,,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,149,,,,,,,,,,,,On the Plurality of (Methodological) Worlds: Estimating the Analytic Flexibility of {fMRI} Experiments,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2012.00149,6,2012,
article,Carpenter2015CB,"The firing patterns of grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) and associated brain areas form triangular arrays that tessellate the environment [1, 2] and maintain constant spatial offsets to each other between environments [3, 4]. These cells are thought to provide an efficient metric for navigation in large-scale space [5, 6, 7, 8]. However, an accurate and universal metric requires grid cell firing patterns to uniformly cover the space to be navigated, in contrast to recent demonstrations that environmental features such as boundaries can distort [9, 10, 11] and fragment [12] grid patterns. To establish whether grid firing is determined by local environmental cues, or provides a coherent global representation, we recorded mEC grid cells in rats foraging in an environment containing two perceptually identical compartments connected via a corridor.

However, with prolonged experience, grid cell firing patterns formed a single, continuous representation that spanned both compartments.

Although the neural mechanisms that underlie these processes are only partially understood, a series of recent papers point to awake memory replay as a potential contributor to both consolidation and retrieval. Replay is the sequential reactivation of hippocampal place cells that represent previously experienced behavioral trajectories and occurs frequently in the awake state, particularly during periods of relative immobility. Awake replay may reflect trajectories through either the current environment or previously visited environments that are spatially remote. The repetition of learned sequences on a compressed time scale is well suited to promote memory consolidation in distributed circuits beyond the hippocampus, suggesting that consolidation occurs in both the awake and sleeping animal.

Replay events consist of precisely timed sequences of spikes from CA3 and CA1 neurons that are coordinated both within and across hemispheres. The mechanism of this coordination is not understood. Here, we show that during SWRs in both awake and quiescent states there are transient increases in slow gamma (20-50 Hz) power and synchrony across dorsal CA3 and CA1 networks of both hemispheres. These gamma oscillations entrain CA3 and CA1 spiking. Moreover, during awake SWRs, higher levels of slow gamma synchrony are predictive of higher quality replay of past experiences.

While a plethora of studies suggested sequential retrieval for deterministic choice outcomes, it remains unclear whether this is also the case when integrating multiple probabilistic outcomes of the same action. We address this question by capitalising on magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans who made choices in a risky foraging task. We train classifiers to distinguish MEG field patterns during presentation of two probabilistic outcomes (reward, loss), and then apply these to decode such patterns during deliberation. First, decoded outcome representations have a temporal structure, suggesting alternating retrieval of the outcomes. Moreover, the probability that one or the other outcome is being represented depends on loss magnitude, but not on loss probability, and it predicts the chosen action. In summary, we demonstrate decodable outcome representations during probabilistic decision-making, which are sequentially structured, depend on task features, and predict subsequent action.",,,,,,,,,"Castegnetti, Giuseppe and Tzovara, Athina and Khemka, Saurabh and Melin{\v s}{\v c}ak, Filip and Barnes, Gareth R. and Dolan, Raymond J. and Bach, Dominik R.",,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,,,,,,,,,2020/05/15,,2021-01-07 17:18:11 +0100,2021-01-07 17:18:26 +0100,,,10.1038/s41467-020-16202-y,,,,,,,,,Castegnetti2020,,2041-1723,,,,Nature Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,2419,,,,,,,,,,,,Representation of probabilistic outcomes during risky decision-making,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16202-y,11,2020,
article,Cavanagh2020FNC,"Neural processing occurs across a range of temporal scales. To facilitate this, the brain uses fast-changing representations reflecting momentary sensory input alongside more temporally extended representations, which integrate across both short and long temporal windows. The temporal flexibility of these representations allows animals to behave adaptively. Short temporal windows facilitate adaptive responding in dynamic environments, while longer temporal windows promote the gradual integration of information across time. In the cognitive and motor domains, the brain sets overarching goals to be achieved within a long temporal window, which must be broken down into sequences of actions and precise movement control processed across much shorter temporal windows. Previous human neuroimaging studies and large-scale artificial network models have ascribed different processing timescales to different cortical regions, linking this to each region's position in an anatomical hierarchy determined by patterns of inter-regional connectivity. However, even within cortical regions, there is variability in responses when studied with single-neuron electrophysiology. Here, we review a series of recent electrophysiology experiments that demonstrate the heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields at the level of single neurons within a cortical region. This heterogeneity appears functionally relevant for the computations that neurons perform during decision-making and working memory. We consider anatomical and biophysical mechanisms that may give rise to a heterogeneity of timescales, including recurrent connectivity, cortical layer distribution, and neurotransmitter receptor expression. Finally, we reflect on the computational relevance of each brain region possessing a heterogeneity of neuronal timescales.

article,Cazin2019PCB,"As rats learn to search for multiple sources of food or water in a complex environment, they generate increasingly efficient trajectories between reward sites. Such spatial navigation capacity involves the replay of hippocampal place-cells during awake states, generating small sequences of spatially related place-cell activity that we call ``snippets''. These snippets occur primarily during sharp-wave-ripples (SWRs). Here we focus on the role of such replay events, as the animal is learning a traveling salesperson task (TSP) across multiple trials. We hypothesize that snippet replay generates synthetic data that can substantially expand and restructure the experience available and make learning more optimal. We developed a model of snippet generation that is modulated by reward, propagated in the forward and reverse directions. This implements a form of spatial credit assignment for reinforcement learning. We use a biologically motivated computational framework known as `reservoir computing' to model prefrontal cortex (PFC) in sequence learning, in which large pools of prewired neural elements process information dynamically through reverberations. This PFC model consolidates snippets into larger spatial sequences that may be later recalled by subsets of the original sequences. Our simulation experiments provide neurophysiological explanations for two pertinent observations related to navigation. Reward modulation allows the system to reject non-optimal segments of experienced trajectories, and reverse replay allows the system to ``learn'' trajectories that it has not physically experienced, both of which significantly contribute to the TSP behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Cazin, Nicolas and Llofriu Alonso, Martin and Scleidorovich Chiodi, Pablo and Pelc, Tatiana and Harland, Bruce and Weitzenfeld, Alfredo and Fellous, Jean-Marc and Dominey, Peter Ford",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-08 13:55:58 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006624,,,"Inman, CoryEditor",,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,PLOS Computational Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,7,,,e1006624,,,,Public Library of Science (PLoS),,,,,,replay; modeling,,Reservoir computing model of prefrontal cortex creates novel combinations of previous navigation sequences from hippocampal place-cell replay with spatial reward propagation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006624,15,2019,
article,Cazin2020BC,"An open problem in the cognitive dimensions of navigation concerns how previous exploratory experience is reorganized in order to allow the creation of novel efficient navigation trajectories. This behavior is revealed in the ``traveling salesrat problem'' (TSP) when rats discover the shortest path linking baited food wells after a few exploratory traversals. We have recently published a model of navigation sequence learning, where sharp wave ripple replay of hippocampal place cells transmit ``snippets'' of the recent trajectories that the animal has explored to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Cazin et al. in PLoS Comput Biol 15:e1006624, 2019). PFC is modeled as a recurrent reservoir network that is able to assemble these snippets into the efficient sequence (trajectory of spatial locations coded by place cell activation). The model of hippocampal replay generates a distribution of snippets as a function of their proximity to a reward, thus implementing a form of spatial credit assignment that solves the TSP task. The integrative PFC reservoir reconstructs the efficient TSP sequence based on exposure to this distribution of snippets that favors paths that are most proximal to rewards. While this demonstrates the theoretical feasibility of the PFC--HIPP interaction, the integration of such a dynamic system into a real-time sensory--motor system remains a challenge. In the current research, we test the hypothesis that the PFC reservoir model can operate in a real-time sensory--motor loop. Thus, the main goal of the paper is to validate the model in simulated and real robot scenarios. Place cell activation encoding the current position of the simulated and physical rat robot feeds the PFC reservoir which generates the successor place cell activation that represents the next step in the reproduced sequence in the readout. This is input to the robot, which advances to the coded location and then generates de novo the current place cell activation. This allows demonstration of the crucial role of embodiment. If the spatial code readout from PFC is played back directly into PFC, error can accumulate, and the system can diverge from desired trajectories. This required a spatial filter to decode the PFC code to a location and then recode a new place cell code for that location. In the robot, the place cell vector output of PFC is used to physically displace the robot and then generate a new place cell coded input to the PFC, replacing part of the software recoding procedure that was required otherwise. We demonstrate how this integrated sensory--motor system can learn simple navigation sequences and then, importantly, how it can synthesize novel efficient sequences based on prior experience, as previously demonstrated (Cazin et al. 2019). This contributes to the understanding of hippocampal replay in novel navigation sequence formation and the important role of embodiment.

article,Chadwick2012N,"Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), or `decoding', of fMRI activity has gained popularity in the neuroimaging community in recent years. MVPA differs from standard fMRI analyses by focusing on whether information relating to specific stimuli is encoded in patterns of activity across multiple voxels. If a stimulus can be predicted, or decoded, solely from the pattern of fMRI activity, it must mean there is information about that stimulus represented in the brain region where the pattern across voxels was identified. This ability to examine the representation of information relating to specific stimuli (e.g., memories) in particular brain areas makes MVPA an especially suitable method for investigating memory representations in brain structures such as the hippocampus. This approach could open up new opportunities to examine hippocampal representations in terms of their content, and how they might change over time, with aging, and pathology. Here we consider published MVPA studies that specifically focused on the hippocampus, and use them to illustrate the kinds of novel questions that can be addressed using MVPA. We then discuss some of the conceptual and methodological challenges that can arise when implementing MVPA in this context.

article,Chen2016NN,"Our lives revolve around sharing experiences and memories with others. When different people recount the same events, how similar are their underlying neural representations?

Individual event patterns were both highly discriminable from one another and similar among people, suggesting consistent spatial organization. In many high-order areas, patterns were more similar between people recalling the same event than between recall and perception, indicating systematic reshaping of percept into memory.

article,Chen2014NC,"Pyramidal cells in the rodent hippocampus often exhibit clear spatial tuning in navigation. Although it has been long suggested that pyramidal cell activity may underlie a topological code rather than a topographic code, it remains unclear whether an abstract spatial topology can be encoded in the ensemble spiking activity of hippocampal place cells. Using a statistical approach developed previously, we investigate this question and related issues in greater detail. We recorded ensembles of hippocampal neurons as rodents freely foraged in one- and two-dimensional spatial environments and used a ``decode-to-uncover'' strategy to examine the temporally structured patterns embedded in the ensemble spiking activity in the absence of observed spatial correlates during periods of rodent navigation or awake immobility. Specifically, the spatial environment was represented by a finite discrete state space. Trajectories across spatial locations (``states'') were associated with consistent hippocampal ensemble spiking patterns, which were characterized by a state transition matrix. From this state transition matrix, we inferred a topology graph that defined the connectivity in the state space. In both one- and two-dimensional environments, the extracted behavior patterns from the rodent hippocampal population codes were compared against randomly shuffled spike data. In contrast to a topographic code, our results support the efficiency of topological coding in the presence of sparse sample size and fuzzy space mapping. This computational approach allows us to quantify the variability of ensemble spiking activity, examine hippocampal population codes during off-line states, and quantify the topological complexity of the environment.",,,,,,,,,"Chen, Zhe and Gomperts, Stephen N. and Yamamoto, Jun and Wilson, Matthew A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 12:06:50 +0200,2020-05-11 12:10:23 +0200,,,10.1162/neco_a_00538,,,,,,,,,,,,1530-888X,,,Neural Computation,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,1,,,1--39,,,,MIT Press - Journals,,,,,,,,Neural Representation of Spatial Topology in the Rodent Hippocampus,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00538,26,2014,

However, the network mechanisms underlying memory storage, consolidation and retrieval remain incompletely understood. Place cell sequences during theta oscillations are thought to be replayed during non-theta states to support consolidation and route planning. In animals with medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) lesions, the temporal organization of theta-related hippocampal activity is disrupted, which allows us to test whether replay is also compromised. Two different analyses---comparison of co-activation patterns between running and rest epochs and analysis of the recurrence of place cell sequences---reveal that the enhancement of replay by behavior is reduced in MEC-lesioned versus control rats. In contrast, the degree of intrinsic network structure prior and subsequent to behavior remains unaffected by MEC lesions.

Spatial activity in the hippocampus is relatively disorganized during the initial exploration of a novel environment, however, and it is unclear how neural activity during the initial stages of learning drives synaptic plasticity. Here we show that pairs of CA1 cells that represent overlapping novel locations are initially more coactive and more precisely coordinated than are cells representing overlapping familiar locations. This increased coordination occurrs specifically during brief, high-frequency events (HFEs) in the local field potential that are similar to ripples and is not associated with better coordination of place-specific neural activity outside of HFEs. As novel locations become more familiar, correlations between cell pairs decrease. Thus, hippocampal neural activity during learning has a unique structure that is well suited to induce synaptic plasticity and to allow for rapid storage of new memories.",,,,,,,,,"Cheng, Sen and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 14:54:31 +0100,2020-10-26 14:54:56 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2007.11.035,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,"SYSNEURO, SYSBIO",,,,,,,,,,,2,,,303 - 313,,,,,,,,,,,,New Experiences Enhance Coordinated Neural Activity in the Hippocampus,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627307010306,57,2008,
article,Chrobak1994JN,"The coordinated activity of hippocampal neurons is reflected by macroscopic patterns, theta and sharp waves (SPW), evident in extracellular field recordings. The importance of these patterns is underscored by the ordered relation of specific neuronal populations to each pattern as well as the relation of each pattern to distinct behavioral states. During awake immobility, consummatory behavior, and slow wave sleep, CA3 and CA1 neurons participate in organized population bursts during SPW. In contrast, during theta-associated exploratory activity, the majority of principle cells are silent. Considerably less is known about the discharge properties of retrohippocampal neurons during theta, and particularly during SPW. These retrohippocampal neurons (entorhinal cortical, parasubicular, presubicular, and subicular) process and transmit information between the neocortex and the hippocampus. The present study examined the activity of these neurons in freely behaving rats during SPW (awake immobility) as well as theta (locomotion and REM sleep). A qualitative distinction between the activity of deep (V-VI) and superficial (II- III) layer retrohippocampal neurons was observed in relation to SPW as compared to theta. Deep layer retrohippocampal neurons exhibited a concurrent increase in activity during hippocampal SPW. In contrast, deep layer neurons were not modulated by the prominent theta oscillations observed throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. On the other hand, superficial layer retrohippocampal neurons were often phase-related to theta oscillations, but were surprisingly indifferent to the SPW-associated population bursting occurring within the deep layers. These findings indicate a concerted discharge of the hippocampal and retrohippocampal cortices during SPW that includes neurons within CA3, CA1, and subiculum as well as neurons in layers V- VI of the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Further, they suggest a temporal discontinuity in the input/output relations between the hippocampus and retrohippocampal structures. We suggest that SPW-associated population bursts in hippocampal and retrohippocampal cortices exert a powerful depolarizing effect on their postsynaptic neocortical targets and may represent a physiological mechanism for memory trace transfer from the hippocampus to the neocortex.",,,,,,,,,"Chrobak, JJ and Buzsaki, G",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-18 10:13:56 +0100,2020-12-18 10:14:17 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.14-10-06160.1994,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/10/6160.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,6160--6170,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Selective activation of deep layer (V-VI) retrohippocampal cortical neurons during hippocampal sharp waves in the behaving rat,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/10/6160,14,1994,

This work specifically focused on supervised learning methods. Both methodological and practical aspects are described in this thesis. Kernel methods have the computational advantage for high dimensional data, therefore they are idea for imaging data. The procedures can be broadly divided into two components: the construction of the kernels and the actual kernel algorithms themselves. Pre-processed functional or anatomical images can be computed into a linear kernel or a non-linear kernel. We introduce both kernel regression and kernel classification algorithms in two main categories: probabilistic methods and non-probabilistic methods. For practical applications, kernel classification methods were applied to decode the cognitive or sensory states of the subject from the fMRI signal and were also applied to discriminate patients with neurological diseases from normal people using anatomical MRI. Kernel regression methods were used to predict the regressors in the design of fMRI experiments, and clinical ratings from the anatomical scans.",,,,,,,,,"Chu, Chia-Yueh Carlton",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 13:39:15 +0200,2020-07-20 14:48:56 +0200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UCL (University College London),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UCL (University College London),,,,,Pattern recognition and machine learning for magnetic resonance images with kernel methods,,,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/18519,,2009,

This article analyzes theoretically and illustrates experimentally the effects of performing TD lambda prediction udpates backwards for a number of past experiences. More exactly, two related techniques described in the literature are examined, referred to as replayed TD and backwards TD. The former is essentially an online learning method which performs at each time step a regular TD 0 update, and then replays updates backwards for a number of previous states. The latter operates in offline mode, after the end of a trial updating backwards the predictions for all visited states. They are both shown to be approximately equivalent to TD lambda with variable lambda values selected in a particular way. This is true even if they perform only TD 0 updates.

In this article, we review recent advances in the field of implicit learning, based on three perspectives: empirical findings (including neuropsychological evidence), methodological issues, and theoretical positions (including computational models). The overall picture that emerges is complex and reflects a field that is very much in flux: while it seems undeniable that cognition involves some form of unconscious processing, it is as yet unclear how to best separate conscious and unconscious influences on learning, and how to best think about the status of the `cognitive unconscious'.

article,Clemens2007B,"Ripples are high-frequency oscillation bursts in the mammalian hippocampus mainly present during Non-REM sleep. In rodents they occur in association with sharp waves and are grouped by the cortical slow oscillation such that, in parallel with sleep spindles, ripple activity is suppressed during the hyperpolarized down-state and enhanced during the depolarized up-state. The temporal coupling between slow oscillations, spindles and ripples has been suggested to serve a hippocampo-neocortical dialogue underlying memory consolidation during sleep. Here, we examined whether a similar coupling exists between these oscillatory phenomena in humans. In sleep recordings from seven epileptic patients, scalp-recorded slow oscillations and spindles as well as parahippocampal ripples recorded from foramen ovale electrodes were identified by automatic algorithms. Additionally, ripple and spindle root mean square activity was determined for relevant frequency bands. Ripple density was higher during Non-REM than REM sleep (P < 0.001). Ripple activity distinctly decreased time-locked to slow oscillation negative half-waves in the three patients without temporal structural alterations (P < 0.001), whereas in the four patients with severe mesiotemporal structural alterations this coupling was obscure. Generally, in the patients ripple activity was increased before spindle peaks and distinctly decreased after the peak (P < 0.001). Ripples were consistently associated with interictal spikes suggesting that spike--ripple complexes represent an epileptic transformation of sharp wave--ripple complexes in the epileptic hippocampus. Our findings are consistent with the notion of a hippocampo-to-neocortical information transfer during sleep that is linked to coordinate ripple and spindle activity, and that in the intact temporal lobe is synchronized to cortical slow oscillations.",,,,,,,,,"Clemens, Z. and Molle, M. and Eross, L. and Barsi, P. and Halasz, P. and Born, J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 15:27:43 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1093/brain/awm146,,,,,,,,,,,,1460-2156,,,Brain,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,11,,,2868--2878,,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),,,,,,,,"Temporal coupling of parahippocampal ripples, sleep spindles and slow oscillations in humans",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awm146,130,2007,
article,Clemens2011EJN,"Sleep‐associated memory consolidation is thought to rely on coordinated information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortex brought about during slow wave sleep (SWS) by distinct local field potential oscillations. Specifically, findings in animals have led to the concept that ripples originating from hippocampus combine with spindles to provide a fine‐tuned temporal frame for a persistent transfer of memory‐related information to the neocortex. The present study focused on characterizing the temporal relationship between parahippocampal ripple activity (80--140 Hz) and spindles recorded from frontal, parietal and parahippocampal cortices in 12 epilepsy patients implanted with parahippocampal foramen ovale electrodes. Overall, parietal and parahippocampal spindles showed closer relationships to parahippocampal ripple activity than frontal spindles, with the latter following parietal and parahippocampal spindles at a variable delay of up to 0.5 s.

Specifically, findings in animals have led to the concept that ripples originating from hippocampus combine with spindles to provide a fine-tuned temporal frame for a persistent transfer of memory-related information to the neocortex. The present study focused on characterizing the temporal relationship between parahippocampal ripple activity (80?140?Hz) and spindles recorded from frontal, parietal and parahippocampal cortices in 12 epilepsy patients implanted with parahippocampal foramen ovale electrodes. Overall, parietal and parahippocampal spindles showed closer relationships to parahippocampal ripple activity than frontal spindles, with the latter following parietal and parahippocampal spindles at a variable delay of up to 0.5?s.

article,Clewett2019H,"Our daily lives unfold continuously, yet when we reflect on the past, we remember those experiences as distinct and cohesive events. To understand this phenomenon, early investigations focused on how and when individuals perceive natural breakpoints, or boundaries, in ongoing experience. More recent research has examined how these boundaries modulate brain mechanisms that support long‐term episodic memory. This work has revealed that a complex interplay between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex promotes the integration and separation of sequential information to help organize our experiences into mnemonic events. Here, we discuss how both temporal stability and change in one's thoughts, goals, and surroundings may provide scaffolding for these neural processes to link and separate memories across time. When learning novel or familiar sequences of information, dynamic hippocampal processes may work both independently from and in concert with other brain regions to bind sequential representations together in memory. The formation and storage of discrete episodic memories may occur both proactively as an experience unfolds. They may also occur retroactively, either during a context shift or when reactivation mechanisms bring the past into the present to allow integration. We also describe conditions and factors that shape the construction and integration of event memories across different timescales.

article,Clewett2020B,"Emotion{\textquoteright}s selective effects on memory go beyond the simple enhancement of threatening or rewarding stimuli. They can also rescue otherwise forgettable memories that share overlapping features. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain mechanisms that support this retrograde memory enhancement. In a two-phase incidental encoding paradigm, participants first view images of neutral tools and animals. During Phase 1, these images are intermixed with neutral scenes, which provides a unique {\textquoteleft}context tag{\textquoteright} for this specific phase of encoding. A few minutes later, during Phase 2, new pictures from one category are paired with a mild shock (fear-conditioned stimulus; CS+), while pictures from the other category are not shocked. fMRI analyses reveal that, across participants, retroactive memory benefits for Phase 1 CS+ items are associated with greater phasic reinstatement of the prior mental context during Phase 2 CS+ items. We also see that greater VTA/SN activation during Phase 2 CS+ items relates to this retroactive memory enhancement, suggesting that emotion promotes both the encoding and ongoing consolidation of overlapping representations. Additionally, we find that emotional experience-dependent changes in post-encoding hippocampal functional coupling with CS+ category-selective cortex relate to the magnitude of the retroactive memory effect. These hippocampal connectivity patterns also mediate the relationship between dopaminergic emotional encoding effects and across-participant variability in the retroactive memory benefit. Collectively, our findings suggest that an interplay between online and offline brain mechanisms may enable emotion to preserve seemingly mundane memories that become significant in the future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Clewett, David and Dunsmoor, Joseph and Bachman, Shelby and Phelps, Elizabeth and Davachi, Lila",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 18:33:21 +0100,2021-01-27 18:34:03 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.07.07.192252,,,,,2020.07.07.192252,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/07/08/2020.07.07.192252.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Survival of the salient: Emotion rescues otherwise forgettable memories via neural reactivation and post-encoding hippocampal connectivity,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/07/08/2020.07.07.192252,,2020,

Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) signal the discrepancy between expected and actual rewards (that is, reward prediction error)1,2,3, but how they compute such signals is unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice associated different odour cues with appetitive and aversive outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31%) or negatively (type III, 18%) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We `tagged' dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons were of type II.

article,Cohn-Sheehy2020B,"Recent studies have suggested that activity in the hippocampus is increased during divisions between events in memory, or event boundaries. Although hippocampal activity at event boundaries may play a role in segregating adjacent events, it might also serve a counterintuitive purpose: to bridge the divide between distant events that form a larger narrative. We used functional neuroimaging to investigate whether patterns of hippocampal activity at event boundaries support the integration of distant events in memory, when these events can form a larger narrative. During encoding of fictional stories, boundary-evoked hippocampal activity patterns were more similar between distant events that formed one coherent narrative, than between distant events from unrelated narratives. Twenty-four hours later, detailed recall of coherent narrative events was supported by the reinstatement of boundary-evoked hippocampal activity from encoding. These findings reveal a key function of the hippocampus: the dynamic integration of events into a narrative structure for memory.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Cohn-Sheehy, Brendan I and Delarazan, Angelique I and Reagh, Zachariah M and Crivelli-Decker, Jordan E and Zacks, Jeffrey M and Ranganath, Charan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 09:59:19 +0100,2020-12-14 09:59:36 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.11.422162,,,,,2020.12.11.422162,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/12/2020.12.11.422162.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,"Bridges, not walls: the hippocampus builds narrative memories across distant events",,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/12/2020.12.11.422162,,2020,

article,Collins2017JCN,"Human learning is highly efficient and flexible. A key contributor to this learning flexibility is our ability to generalize new information across contexts that we know require the same behavior and to transfer rules to new contexts we encounter. To do this, we structure the information we learn and represent it hierarchically as abstract, context-dependent rules that constrain lower-level stimulus--action--outcome contingencies. Previous research showed that humans create such structure even when it is not needed, presumably because it usually affords long-term generalization benefits. However, computational models predict that creating structure is costly, with slower learning and slower RTs. We tested this prediction in a new behavioral experiment. Participants learned to select correct actions for four visual patterns, in a setting that either afforded (but did not promote) structure learning or enforced nonhierarchical learning, while controlling for the difficulty of the learning problem. Results replicated our previous finding that healthy young adults create structure even when unneeded and that this structure affords later generalization. Furthermore, they supported our prediction that structure learning incurred a major learning cost and that this cost was specifically tied to the effort in selecting abstract rules, leading to more errors when applying those rules. These findings confirm our theory that humans pay a high short-term cost in learning structure to enable longer-term benefits in learning flexibility.",,,,,,,,,"Collins, Anne G.

article,Collins2020NRN,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework of particular importance to psychology, neuroscience and machine learning. Interactions between these fields, as promoted through the common hub of RL, has facilitated paradigm shifts that relate multiple levels of analysis in a singular framework (for example, relating dopamine function to a computationally defined RL signal). Recently, more sophisticated RL algorithms have been proposed to better account for human learning, and in particular its oft-documented reliance on two separable systems: a model-based (MB) system and a model-free (MF) system. However, along with many benefits, this dichotomous lens can distort questions, and may contribute to an unnecessarily narrow perspective on learning and decision-making.

article,Collins2013PR,"Learning and executive functions such as task-switching share common neural substrates, notably prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Understanding how they interact requires studying how cognitive control facilitates learning but also how learning provides the (potentially hidden) structure, such as abstract rules or task-sets, needed for cognitive control. We investigate this question from 3 complementary angles. First, we develop a new context-task-set (C-TS) model, inspired by nonparametric Bayesian methods, specifying how the learner might infer hidden structure (hierarchical rules) and decide to reuse or create new structure in novel situations. Second, we develop a neurobiologically explicit network model to assess mechanisms of such structured learning in hierarchical frontal cortex and basal ganglia circuits. We systematically explore the link between these modeling levels across task demands. We find that the network provides an approximate implementation of high-level C-TS computations, with specific neural mechanisms modulating distinct C-TS parameters. Third, this synergism yields predictions about the nature of human optimal and suboptimal choices and response times during learning and task-switching. In particular, the models suggest that participants spontaneously build task-set structure into a learning problem when not cued to do so, which predicts positive and negative transfer in subsequent generalization tests. We provide experimental evidence for these predictions and show that C-TS provides a good quantitative fit to human sequences of choices. These findings implicate a strong tendency to interactively engage cognitive control and learning, resulting in structured abstract representations that afford generalization opportunities and, thus, potentially long-term rather than short-term optimality.",,,,,,,,,"Collins, Anne G.

article,Cooley2020NBE,"Access to scanners for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically limited by cost and by infrastructure requirements. Here, we report the design and testing of a portable prototype scanner for brain MRI that uses a compact and lightweight permanent rare-earth magnet with a built-in readout field gradient. The 122-kg low-field (80 mT) magnet has a Halbach cylinder design that results in a minimal stray field and requires neither cryogenics nor external power. The built-in magnetic field gradient reduces the reliance on high-power gradient drivers, lowering the overall requirements for power and cooling, and reducing acoustic noise. Imperfections in the encoding fields are mitigated with a generalized iterative image reconstruction technique that leverages previous characterization of the field patterns. In healthy adult volunteers, the scanner can generate T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density-weighted brain images with a spatial resolution of 2.2 ×1.3 ×6.8 mm3.

article,Corman2020M,"Antigen point of care tests (AgPOCT) can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 testing. As first AgPOCT are becoming available, there is a growing interest in their utility and performance.Methods Here we compare AgPOCT products by seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio{\texttrademark} COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test; the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag; the Healgen{\textregistered} Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab); the Coris Bioconcept Covid.19 Ag Respi-Strip; the R-Biopharm RIDA{\textregistered}QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen; the NAL von minden NADAL COVID19-Ag Test; and the Roche/SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored clinical samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (n=138), stored samples from patients with respiratory agents other than SARS-CoV-2 (n=100), as well as self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers (n=35).Findings Limits of detection in six of seven tested products ranged between 2.08 {\texttimes} 106 and 2.88 {\texttimes} 107 copies per swab, the outlier at 1.58 {\texttimes} 1010 copies per swab. Specificities ranged between 98.53\% and 100\% in five products, with two outliers at 94.85\% and 88.24\%. False positive results were not associated with any specific respiratory agent. As some of the tested AgPOCT were early production lots, the observed issues with specificity are unlikely to persist.Interpretation The sensitivity range of most AgPOCT overlaps with viral load figures typically observed during the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in the majority patients. AgPOCTs with a limit of detection that approximates the virus concentration above which patients are infectious may enable shortcuts in decision-making in various areas of healthcare and public health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementParts of this work was funded by European Union DG Research through projects Prepare (GA602525) and Compare (GA643476) to CD, the German Ministry of Research through projects RAPID (01KI1723A) and DZIF (301-4-7-01.703) to CD, by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (ZIM 16KN073824) to VMC, and by the German Ministry of Health (Konsiliarlabor fuer Coronaviren) to CD and VMC.

article,Coutanche2012N,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are broken up into runs (or `sessions'), frequently selected to be long to minimize across-run signal variations. For investigations that use multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), however, employing many short runs might improve a classifier's ability to generalize across irrelevant pattern variations and detect condition-related activity patterns. We directly tested this hypothesis by scanning participants with both long and short runs and comparing MVPA performance using data from each set of runs. Every run included presentations of faces, places, man-made objects and fruit in a blocked 1-back design. MVPA performance significantly improved from using a large number of short runs, compared to several long runs, in across-run classifications with identical amounts of data. Superior classification was found across variations in the classifier employed, feature selection procedure and region of interest. Performance improvements also extended to an information brain mapping `searchlight' procedure.

article,Covington2018JCN,"Converging evidence points to a role for the hippocampus in statistical learning, but open questions about its necessity remain. Evidence for necessity comes from Schapiro and colleagues who report that a single patient with damage to hippocampus and broader medial temporal lobe cortex was unable to discriminate new from old sequences in several statistical learning tasks. The aim of the current study was to replicate these methods in a larger group of patients who have either damage localized to hippocampus or broader medial temporal lobe damage, to ascertain the necessity of the hippocampus in statistical learning. Patients with hippocampal damage consistently showed less learning overall compared with healthy comparison participants, consistent with an emerging consensus for hippocampal contributions to statistical learning. Interestingly, lesion size did not reliably predict performance. However, patients with hippocampal damage were not uniformly at chance and demonstrated above-chance performance in some task variants.

article,Cowen2020H,"Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples are brief high-frequency (120--250 Hz) oscillatory events that support mnemonic processes during sleep and awake behavior. Although ripples occurring during sleep are believed to facilitate memory consolidation, waking ripples may also be involved in planning and memory retrieval. Recent work from our group determined that normal aging results in a significant reduction in the peak oscillatory frequency and rate-of-occurrence of ripples during sleep that may contribute to age-associated memory decline. It is unknown, however, how aging alters waking ripples. We investigated whether characteristics of waking ripples undergo age-dependent changes. Sharp-wave ripple events were recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus in old (n = 5) and young (n = 6) F344 male rats as they performed a place-dependent eyeblink conditioning task. Several novel observations emerged from this analysis. First, although aged rats expressed more waking ripples than young rats during track running and reward consumption, this effect was eliminated, and, in the case of track-running, reversed when time spent in each location was accounted for. Thus, aged rats emit more ripples, but young rats express a higher ripple rate. This likely results from reduced locomotor activity in aged animals. Furthermore, although ripple rates increased as young rats approached rewards, rates did not increase in aged rats, and rates in aged and young animals were not affected by eyeblink conditioning. Finally, although the oscillatory frequency of ripples was lower in aged animals during rest, frequencies in aged rats increased during behavior to levels indistinguishable from young rats. Given the involvement of waking ripples in memory retrieval, a possible consequence of slower movement speeds of aged animals is to provide more opportunity to replay task-relevant information and compensate for age-related declines in ripple rate during task performance.",,,,,,,,,"Cowen, Stephen L. and Gray, Daniel T. and Wiegand, Jean-Paul L. and Schimanski, Lesley A. and Barnes, Carol A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-09 07:53:28 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.23005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"oscillation, reactivation, working memory",,,,,,,,,,,1,,,28-38,,,,,,,,,,ripples,,Age-associated changes in waking hippocampal sharp-wave ripples,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23005,30,2020,
article,Cox2003N,"Traditional (univariate) analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data relies exclusively on the information contained in the time course of individual voxels. Multivariate analyses can take advantage of the information contained in activity patterns across space, from multiple voxels. Such analyses have the potential to greatly expand the amount of information extracted from fMRI data sets. In the present study, multivariate statistical pattern recognition methods, including linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines, were used to classify patterns of fMRI activation evoked by the visual presentation of various categories of objects. Classifiers were trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest during a subset of trials for each subject individually. Classification of subsequently collected fMRI data was attempted according to the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples. Classification was done using only small amounts of data (20 s worth) at a time, so such a technique could, in principle, be used to extract information about a subject's percept on a near real-time basis. Classifiers trained on data acquired during one session were equally accurate in classifying data collected within the same session and across sessions separated by more than a week, in the same subject. Although the highest classification accuracies were obtained using patterns of activity including lower visual areas as input, classification accuracies well above chance were achieved using regions of interest restricted to higher-order object-selective visual areas. In contrast to typical fMRI data analysis, in which hours of data across many subjects are averaged to reveal slight differences in activation, the use of pattern recognition methods allows a subtle 10-way discrimination to be performed on an essentially trial-by-trial basis within individuals, demonstrating that fMRI data contain far more information than is typically appreciated.",,,,,,,,,"Cox, David D and Savoy, Robert L",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 12:55:31 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00049-1,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,2,,,261--270,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,MRI; MVPA,,Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) {``brain reading''}: detecting and classifying distributed patterns of {fMRI} activity in human visual cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00049-1,19,2003,

Using intracranial recordings in four pre-surgical epilepsy patients, we discovered ripples within human amygdala during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Like hippocampal ripples, amygdala ripples are strongly associated with sharp waves, are linked to sleep spindles, and tend to co-occur with their hippocampal counterparts. Moreover, sharp waves and ripples are temporally linked across the two brain structures, with amygdala ripples occurring during hippocampal sharp waves and vice versa. Combined with further evidence of interregional sharp wave and spindle synchronization, these findings offer a potential physiological substrate for the sleep-dependent consolidation and regulation of emotional experiences.",,,,,,,,,"Cox, Roy and Ruber, Theodor and Staresina, Bernhard and Fell, Juergen",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-09 15:20:43 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.01.07.897413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Sharp-wave ripples in human amygdala and their coordination with hippocampus,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.07.897413,,2020,
article,Craig2015H,"People retain more new verbal episodic information for at least 7 days if they rest for a few minutes after learning than if they attend to new information. It is hypothesized that rest allows for superior consolidation of new memories. In rodents, rest periods promote hippocampal replay of a recently travelled route, and this replay is thought to be critical for memory consolidation and subsequent spatial navigation. If rest boosts human memory by promoting hippocampal replay/consolidation, then the beneficial effect of rest should extend to complex (hippocampal) memory tasks, for example, tasks probing associations and sequences. We investigated this question via a virtual reality route memory task. Healthy young participants learned two routes to a 100% criterion. One route was followed by a 10‐min rest and the other by a 10‐min spot the difference game. For each learned route, participants performed four delayed spatial memory tests probing: (i) associative (landmark‐direction) memory, (ii) cognitive map formation, (iii) temporal (landmark) order memory, and (iv) route memory. Tests were repeated after 7 days to determine any long‐term effects. No effect of rest was detected in the route memory or cognitive map tests, most likely due to ceiling and floor effects, respectively. Rest did, however, boost retention in the associative memory and temporal order memory tests, and this boost remained for at least 7 days. We therefore demonstrate that the benefit of rest extends to (spatial) associative and temporal order memory in humans. We hypothesise that rest allows superior consolidation/hippocampal replay of novel information pertaining to a recently learned route, thus boosting new memories over the long term.",,,,,,,,,"Craig, Michael and Dewar, Michaela and Della Sala, Sergio and Wolbers, Thomas",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-20 08:14:20 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.22424,,,,,,,,,,,,1050-9631,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,9,,,1017--1027,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Rest boosts the long-term retention of spatial associative and temporal order information,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22424,25,2015,
article,Craig2015aH,"Flexible spatial navigation, e.g. the ability to take novel shortcuts, is contingent upon accurate mental representations of environments‐cognitive maps. These cognitive maps critically depend on hippocampal place cells. In rodents, place cells replay recently travelled routes, especially during periods of behavioural inactivity (sleep/wakeful rest). This neural replay is hypothesised to promote not only the consolidation of specific experiences, but also their wider integration, e.g. into accurate cognitive maps. In humans, rest promotes the consolidation of specific experiences, but the effect of rest on the wider integration of memories remained unknown. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that cognitive map formation is supported by rest‐related integration of new spatial memories. We predicted that if wakeful rest supports cognitive map formation, then rest should enhance knowledge of overarching spatial relations that were never experienced directly during recent navigation. Forty young participants learned a route through a virtual environment before either resting wakefully or engaging in an unrelated perceptual task for 10 min. Participants in the wakeful rest condition performed more accurately in a delayed cognitive map test, requiring the pointing to landmarks from a range of locations. Importantly, the benefit of rest could not be explained by active rehearsal, but can be attributed to the promotion of consolidation‐related activity. These findings (i) resonate with the demonstration of hippocampal replay in rodents, and (ii) provide the first evidence that wakeful rest can improve the integration of new spatial memories in humans, a function that has, hitherto, been associated with sleep.",,,,,,,,,"Craig, Michael and Dewar, Michaela and Harris, Mathew A. and Della Sala, Sergio and Wolbers, Thomas",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-20 08:18:17 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.22502,,,,,,,,,,,,1050-9631,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,2,,,185--193,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Wakeful rest promotes the integration of spatial memories into accurate cognitive maps,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22502,26,2015,
article,Craig2019H,"Post‐navigation awake quiescence, relative to task engagement, benefits the accuracy of a new ``cognitive map''. This effect is hypothesized to reflect awake quiescence, like sleep, being conducive to the consolidation and integration of new spatial memories. Sleep has been shown to improve cognitive map accuracy over time. It remained unknown whether awake quiescence can induce similar time‐related improvements in new cognitive maps, or whether it simply counteracts their decay. We examined this question via two experiments. In Experiment 1, using an established cognitive mapping paradigm, we reveal that map accuracy for a virtual town was significantly better in people whose memory was probed after 10 min of post‐navigation awake quiescence or ongoing cognitive engagement, relative to those whose memory was probed shortly after initial navigation. In Experiment 2, using a newly developed cognitive mapping task that involved a more complex and real‐life virtual town, we again found that map accuracy was superior in those whose memory was probed after 10 min of awake quiescence than those who were tested soon after navigation. These findings indicate that actual improvements in human memories are not restricted to sleep.

Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations.

After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time.

We have found similar reverse-order reactivation during SWRs inopen-field exploration where the firing sequence of cells varied before each SWR. Both the onset times and the firing patterns of cellsshowed a tendency for reversed sequences during SWRs. These effects were observed for SWRs that occurred during exploration,but not for those during longer immobility periods. Additionally, reverse reactivation was stronger when it was preceded by higherspeed (> 5 cm⁄s) run periods. The trend for reverse-order SWR reactivation was not significantly different in familiar and novelenvironments, even though SWR-associated firing rates of both pyramidal cells and interneurons were reduced in novelenvironments as compared with familiar. During exploration-associated SWRs (eSWR) place cells retain place-selective firing[O'Neillet al.(2006)Neuron, 49, 143--155]. Here, we have shown that each cell's firing onset was more delayed and firing probabilitymore reduced during eSWRs the further the rat was from the middle of the cell's place field; that is, cells receiving less momentaryplace-related excitatory drive fired later during SWR events. However, even controlling for place field distance, the recent firing ofcells was still significantly correlated with SWR reactivation sequences. We therefore propose that both place-related drive and thefiring history of cells contribute to reverse reactivation during eSWRs.",,,,,,,,,"Csicsvari, Jozsef and O'Neill, Joseph and Allen, Kevin and Senior, Timothy",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-04 16:10:23 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05684.x,,,,,,,,,,,,0953-816X,,,European Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,3,,,704--716,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Place-selective firing contributes to the reverse-order reactivation of {CA1} pyramidal cells during sharp waves in open-field exploration,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05684.x,26,2007,

Place cells, initially thought to be location-specifiers, turn out to respond promiscuously to a wide range of stimuli. Here we test the idea, which we have recently demonstrated in a computational model, that the hippocampal place cells may ultimately be interested in a space's topological qualities (its connectivity) more than its geometry (distances and angles); such higher-order functioning would be more consistent with other known hippocampal functions. We recorded place cell activity in rats exploring morphing linear tracks that allowed us to dissociate the geometry of the track from its topology. The resulting place fields preserved the relative sequence of places visited along the track but did not vary with the metrical features of the track or the direction of the rat's movement.

article,Dabney2020N,"Since its introduction, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine has explained a wealth of empirical phenomena, providing a unifying framework for understanding the representation of reward and value in the brain1,2,3. According to the now canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. Here we propose an account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional reinforcement learning4,5,6.

article,Dale1999HBM,"An important challenge in the design and analysis of event‐related or single‐trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event‐related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a fixed inter‐stimulus‐interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event‐related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept fixed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by fixed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro‐/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacrificing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.",,,,,,,,,"Dale, Anders M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-24 13:59:42 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/(sici)1097-0193(1999)8:2/3<109::aid-hbm7>3.0.co;2-w,,,,,,,,,,,,1097-0193,,,Human Brain Mapping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2-3,,,109--114,,,,Wiley,,,,,,MRI; methods,,Optimal experimental design for event-related fMRI,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0193(1999)8:2/3<109::AID-HBM7>3.0.CO;2-W,8,1999,
article,Dale1997HBM,"A major limitation in conducting functional neuroimaging studies, particularly for cognitive experiments, has been the use of blocked task paradigms. Here we explored whether selective averaging techniques similar to those applied in event‐related potential (ERP) experiments could be used to demonstrate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to rapidly intermixed trials. In the first two experiments, we observed that for 1‐sec trials of full‐field visual checkerboard stimulation, the fMRI blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) signal summated in a roughly linear fashion across successive trials even at very short (2 sec and 5 sec) intertrial intervals, although subtle departures from linearity were observed. In experiments 3 and 4, we observed that it is possible to obtain robust activation maps for rapidly presented randomly mixed trial types (left‐ and right‐hemifield visual checkerboard stimulation) spaced as little as 2 sec apart. Taken collectively, these results suggest that selective averaging may enable fMRI experimental designs identical to those used in typical behavioral and ERP studies. The ability to analyze closely spaced single‐trial, or event‐related, signals provides for a class of experiments which cannot be conducted using blocked designs. Trial types can be randomly intermixed, and selective averaging based upon trial type and/or subject performance is possible.",,,,,,,,,"Dale, Anders M. and Buckner, Randy L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-24 14:00:52 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/(sici)1097-0193(1997)5:5<329::aid-hbm1>3.0.co;2-5,,,,,,,,,,,,1065-9471,,,Human Brain Mapping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,329--340,,,,Wiley,,,,,,MRI; methods,,Selective averaging of rapidly presented individual trials using fMRI,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0193(1997)5:5<329::AID-HBM1>3.0.CO;2-5,5,1997,

Its primary output cells, CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1 PCs), vary in genetics, morphology, connectivity, and electrophysiological properties. It is therefore possible that distinct CA1 PC subpopulations encode different features of the environment and differentially contribute to learning. To test this hypothesis, we optically monitored activity in deep and superficial CA1 PCs segregated along the radial axis of the mouse hippocampus and assessed the relationship between sublayer dynamics and learning. Superficial place maps were more stable than deep during head-fixed exploration. Deep maps, however, were preferentially stabilized during goal-oriented learning, and representation of the reward zone by deep cells predicted task performance. These findings demonstrate that superficial CA1 PCs provide a more stable map of an environment, while their counterparts in the deep sublayer provide a more flexible representation that is shaped by learning about salient features in the environment.",,,,,,,,,"Danielson, Nathan B. and Zaremba, Jeffrey D. and Kaifosh, Patrick and Bowler, John and Ladow, Max and Losonczy, Attila",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-11 16:57:59 +0100,2020-12-11 16:58:30 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.06.020,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,652 - 665,,,,,,,,,,,,Sublayer-Specific Coding Dynamics during Spatial Navigation and Learning in Hippocampal Area CA1,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627316302987,91,2016,

Furthermore, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence in humans suggests that medial temporal lobe cortical input structures, the perirhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortices, differentially participate in the encoding of objects and their context, providing domain-specific input to the hippocampus.

For neurons in a motor cortex analog of adult zebra finches, we show that the timing and structure of activity elicited by the playback of song during sleep matches activity during daytime singing. The motor activity leads syllables, and the matching sensory response depends on a sequence of typically up to three of the preceding syllables. Thus, sensorimotor correspondence is reflected in temporally precise activity patterns of single neurons that use long sensory memories to predict syllable sequences. Additionally, ``spontaneous'' activity of these neurons during sleep matches their sensorimotor activity, a form of song ``replay.'' These data suggest a model whereby sensorimotor correspondences are stored during singing but do not modify behavior, and off-line comparison (e.g., during sleep) of rehearsed motor output and predicted sensory feedback is used to adaptively shape motor output.",,,,,,,,,"Dave, Amish S. and Margoliash, Daniel",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAXLi4vcGFwZXJzL2RhdmUyMDAwcy5wZGZPEQFeAAAAAAFeAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8NZGF2ZTIwMDBzLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACADwvOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOmRhdmUyMDAwcy5wZGYADgAcAA0AZABhAHYAZQAyADAAMAAwAHMALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA6VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvZGF2ZTIwMDBzLnBkZgATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJAA+AAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA=,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-27 18:58:54 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1126/science.290.5492.812,,,,,,,,,,,,1095-9203,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,5492,,,812--816,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS),,,,,,,,Song Replay During Sleep and Computational Rules for Sensorimotor Vocal Learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.290.5492.812,290,2000,

In the present research, we provide evidence that the hippocampus is also involved with another function---utilization of hunger state signals. Rats with selective ibotenate lesions of the hippocampus were found to be impaired in their ability to discriminate between the interoceptive sensory consequences of food deprivation and satiation. At the same time the ability of these rats to discriminate between different exteroceptive cues was unaffected. These results suggest that deficits in discriminative performance were specific to interoceptive state stimuli. In addition, hippocampal-damaged rats also seemed unable to use their food deprivation stimuli as signals to engage in normal feeding behavior.

Such ``replay'' co-occurs with ripple events: short-lasting (∼50--120 ms), high-frequency (∼200 Hz) oscillations that are associated with increased hippocampal-cortical communication. In previous studies, rats exploring small environments showed replay anchored to the rat's current location and compressed in time into a single ripple event. Here, we show, using a neural decoding approach, that firing sequences corresponding to long runs through a large environment are replayed with high fidelity and that such replay can begin at remote locations on the track. Extended replay proceeds at a characteristic virtual speed of ∼8 m/s and remains coherent across trains of ripple events.

article,Daw2005NN,"A broad range of neural and behavioral data suggests that the brain contains multiple systems for behavioral choice, including one associated with prefrontal cortex and another with dorsolateral striatum. However, such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. Here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience.

The present review focuses on the well-delimited issue of how an external or internal piece of information goes beyond nonconscious processing and gains access to conscious processing, a transition characterized by the existence of a reportable subjective experience. Converging neuroimaging and neurophysiological data, acquired during minimal experimental contrasts between conscious and nonconscious processing, point to objective neural measures of conscious access: late amplification of relevant sensory activity, long-distance cortico-cortical synchronization at beta and gamma frequencies, and ``ignition'' of a large-scale prefronto-parietal network. We compare these findings to current theoretical models of conscious processing, including the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model according to which conscious access occurs when incoming information is made globally available to multiple brain systems through a network of neurons with long-range axons densely distributed in prefrontal, parieto-temporal, and cingulate cortices.

article,Deng2020B,"Humans have the ability to retrieve memories with various degrees of specificity, and recent advances in reinforcement learning have identified benefits to learning when past experience is represented at different levels of temporal abstraction. How this flexibility might be implemented in the brain remains unclear. We analyzed the temporal organization of rat hippocampal population spiking to identify potential substrates for temporally flexible representations. We examined activity both during locomotion and during memory-retrieval-associated population events known as sharp wave-ripples (SWRs). We found that spiking during SWRs is rhythmically organized with higher event-to-event variability than spiking during locomotion-associated population events. Decoding analyses using clusterless methods further suggest that similar spatial experience can be replayed in multiple SWRs, each time with a different rhythmic structure whose periodicity is sampled from a lognormal distribution. This variability is preserved despite the decline in SWR rates that occurs as environments become more familiar: in more familiar environments the width of the lognormal distribution increases, further enhancing the range of temporal variability. We hypothesize that the variability in temporal organization of hippocampal spiking provides a mechanism for retrieving remembered experiences with various degrees of specificity.",,,,,,,,,"Deng, Xinyi and Chen, Shizhe and Sosa, Marielena and Karlsson, Mattias P. and Wei, Xue-Xin and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-14 09:55:09 +0200,2020-04-14 09:58:07 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.04.10.035980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,replay,,A Variable Clock Underlies Internally Generated Hippocampal Sequences,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.035980,,2020,
article,Denovellis2020B,"Representations of past and possible future experiences play a critical role in memory and decision-making processes. The hippocampus expresses these types of representations during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, and previous work identified a minority of SWRs that contain ""replay"" of spatial trajectories at ~20x real-world speeds. Efforts to understand replay typically make multiple assumptions about which events to examine and what sorts of representations constitute replay. We therefore lack a clear understanding of both the prevalence and the range of representational dynamics associated with replay. Here we develop a state space model that uses a combination of movement dynamics of different speeds to capture the spatial content and time evolution of replay during SWRs. Using this model, we find that the large majority of replay events contain spatially coherent, interpretable content. Furthermore, most events progress at real-world, rather than accelerated, movement speeds, consistent with actual experiences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Denovellis, Eric L. and Gillespie, Anna K. and Coulter, Michael E. and Sosa, Marielena and Chung, Jason E. and Eden, Uri T. and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 09:06:06 +0100,2020-10-27 09:14:14 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.10.20.347708,,,,,2020.10.20.347708,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/23/2020.10.20.347708.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Hippocampal replay of experience at real-world speeds,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/23/2020.10.20.347708,,2020,

article,Detre2013N,"Using the think/no-think paradigm (Anderson & Green, 2001), researchers have found that suppressing retrieval of a memory (in the presence of a strong retrieval cue) can make it harder to retrieve that memory on a subsequent test. This effect has been replicated numerous times, but the size of the effect is highly variable. Also, it is unclear from a neural mechanistic standpoint why preventing recall of a memory now should impair your ability to recall that memory later. Here, we address both of these puzzles using the idea, derived from computational modeling and studies of synaptic plasticity, that the function relating memory activation to learning is U-shaped, such that moderate levels of memory activation lead to weakening of the memory and higher levels of activation lead to strengthening. According to this view, forgetting effects in the think/no-think paradigm occur when the suppressed item activates moderately during the suppression attempt, leading to weakening; the effect is variable because sometimes the suppressed item activates strongly (leading to strengthening) and sometimes it does not activate at all (in which case no learning takes place). To test this hypothesis, we ran a think/no-think experiment where participants learned word-picture pairs; we used pattern classifiers, applied to fMRI data, to measure how strongly the picture associates were activating when participants were trying not to retrieve these associates, and we used a novel Bayesian curve-fitting procedure to relate this covert neural measure of retrieval to performance on a later memory test. In keeping with our hypothesis, the curve-fitting procedure revealed a nonmonotonic relationship between memory activation (as measured by the classifier) and subsequent memory, whereby moderate levels of activation of the to-be-suppressed item led to diminished performance on the final memory test, and higher levels of activation led to enhanced performance on the final test.",,,,,,,,,"Detre, Greg J. and Natarajan, Annamalai and Gershman, Samuel J. and Norman, Kenneth A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 16:07:15 +0100,2020-10-26 16:42:51 +0100,,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.02.017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neuropsychologia,,,,,,,,,,,oct,,,12,,,2371--2388,,,,Elsevier {BV},,,,,,,,Moderate levels of activation lead to forgetting in the think/no-think paradigm,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.02.017,51,2013,
article,Deuker2013JN,"Memory consolidation transforms initially labile memory traces into more stable representations. One putative mechanism for consolidation is the reactivation of memory traces after their initial encoding during subsequent sleep or waking state. However, it is still unknown whether consolidation of individual memory contents relies on reactivation of stimulus-specific neural representations in humans. Investigating stimulus-specific representations in humans is particularly difficult, but potentially feasible using multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA). Here, we show in healthy human participants that stimulus-specific activation patterns can indeed be identified with MVPA, that these patterns reoccur spontaneously during postlearning resting periods and sleep, and that the frequency of reactivation predicts subsequent memory for individual items. We conducted a paired-associate learning task with items and spatial positions and extracted stimulus-specific activity patterns by MVPA in a simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. As a first step, we investigated the amount of fMRI volumes during rest that resembled either one of the items shown before or one of the items shown as a control after the resting period. Reactivations during both awake resting state and sleep predicted subsequent memory.

Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples --- at minimum cholinergic activity --- coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity --- at high cholinergic and theta activity --- might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.",,,,,,,,,"Diekelmann, Susanne and Born, Jan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-14 14:48:59 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/nrn2762,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-0048,,,Nature Reviews Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,2,,,114--126,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,The memory function of sleep,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn2762,11,2010,

article,Doeller2010N,"Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex of freely moving rats provide a strikingly periodic representation of self-location1 which is indicative of very specific computational mechanisms2,3,4. However, the existence of grid cells in humans and their distribution throughout the brain are unknown. Here we show that the preferred firing directions of directionally modulated grid cells in rat entorhinal cortex are aligned with the grids, and that the spatial organization of grid-cell firing is more strongly apparent at faster than slower running speeds. Because the grids are also aligned with each other1,5, we predicted a macroscopic signal visible to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We then looked for this signal as participants explored a virtual reality environment, mimicking the rats' foraging task: fMRI activation and adaptation showing a speed-modulated six-fold rotational symmetry in running direction. The signal was found in a network of entorhinal/subicular, posterior and medial parietal, lateral temporal and medial prefrontal areas. The effect was strongest in right entorhinal cortex, and the coherence of the directional signal across entorhinal cortex correlated with spatial memory performance. Our study illustrates the potential power of combining single-unit electrophysiology with fMRI in systems neuroscience.

While choices and neural correlates of decision variables sometimes reflect knowledge of their consequences, it remains unclear whether this actually arises from prospective evaluation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a sequential reward-learning task in which paths contained decodable object categories, we found that humans' model-based choices were associated with neural signatures of future paths observed at decision time, suggesting a prospective mechanism for choice. Prospection also covaried with the degree of model-based influences on neural correlates of decision variables and was inversely related to prediction error signals thought to underlie model-free learning.

PH prediction error signals predicted exploration whereas AH global value maximum signals predicted exploitation. AH-mediated exploitation depended on value representations compressed across episodes and options.

Exploration of spatially unstructured options depends on the neocortex, striatum, and amygdala.

The hippocampus binds reward information into allocentric cognitive maps to support navigation and foraging in such spaces. Here we report that human posterior hippocampus (PH) invigorates exploration while anterior hippocampus (AH) supports the transition to exploitation on a reinforcement learning task with a spatially structured reward function. These dynamics depend on differential reinforcement representations in the PH and AH.

In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work.

We thus asked how grid cells are affected by the nature of the input from the place cells. We propose a single-layer neural network with feedforward weights connecting place-like input cells to grid cell outputs. Place-to-grid weights are learned via a generalized Hebbian rule. The architecture of this network highly resembles neural networks used to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Both numerical results and analytic considerations indicate that if the components of the feedforward neural network are non-negative, the output converges to a hexagonal lattice. Without the non-negativity constraint, the output converges to a square lattice. Consistent with experiments, grid spacing ratio between the first two consecutive modules is −1.4.

Subjects in the DaySleep and ImmDaySleep conditions were trained in the morning and at noon, respectively, afforded a 90-min nap early in the afternoon and were re-tested 12 h post-training.

The results of the FTSL task revealed that post-training sleep (day-time nap or night-time sleep) significantly promoted the expression of delayed gains at 12 h post-training, especially if sleep was afforded immediately after training. In the VMA task, however, there were no significant differences in the gains expressed at 12 h post-training in the three conditions. These findings suggest that ``off-line''performance gains reflecting consolidation processes in the FTSL task benefit from sleep, even a short nap, while the simple passage of time is as effective as time in sleep for consolidation of VMA to occur. They also imply that procedural memory consolidation processes differ depending on the nature of task demands.",,,,,,,,,"Doyon, Julien and Korman, Maria and Morin, Am{\'e}lie and Dostie, Val{\'e}rie and Tahar, Abdallah Hadj and Benali, Habib and Karni, Avi and Ungerleider, Leslie G. and Carrier, Julie",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 12:37:05 +0100,2020-10-27 12:37:29 +0100,,,10.1007/s00221-009-1748-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Experimental Brain Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,15--26,,,,,,,,,,,,Contribution of night and day sleep vs. simple passage of time to the consolidation of motor sequence and visuomotor adaptation learning,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-009-1748-y,195,2009,
article,Dragoi2013PNAS,"The activity of ensembles of hippocampal place cells represents a hallmark of an animal's spatial experience. The neuronal mechanisms that enable the rapid expression of novel place cell sequences are not entirely understood. Here we report that during sleep or rest, distinct sets of hippocampal temporal sequences in the rat preplay multiple corresponding novel spatial experiences with high specificity. These findings suggest that the place cell sequence of a novel spatial experience is determined, in part, by an online selection of a subset of cellular firing sequences from a larger repertoire of preexisting temporal firing sequences in the hippocampal cellular assembly network that become rapidly bound to the novel experience. We estimate that for the given context, the recorded hippocampal network activity has the capacity to preplay an extended repertoire of at least 15 future spatial experiences of similar distinctiveness and complexity. It is a matter of debate whether specific sequences of place cells (1) encoding different novel spatial experiences in the rat are formed exclusively during the experiences (2⇓--4) or are, in part, preconfigured in the form of correlated temporal sequences that are expressed before the experience (5⇓--7). Previous work in mice has shown that in the na{\""\i}ve animal, temporal firing sequences expressed in association with sharp-wave ripples during sleep or rest can preplay future spatial sequences of place cells encoding novel environments (5). However, it remains unclear whether place cell sequences encoding a novel spatial experience are preconfigured as a dominant cluster of temporal sequences preferentially preplaying the subsequent experience or whether they are selected from an existing larger repertoire of temporally organized sequences. The latter would confer the hippocampal network with the capacity to rapidly encode multiple parallel spatial experiences, but the extent of this capacity has not been addressed experimentally.

Such correlations could arise due to spike ``phase precession'' of independent neurons driven by common theta pacemaker or as a result of temporal coordination among specific hippocampal cell assemblies. We found that temporal correlation between place cell pairs was stronger than predicted by a pacemaker drive of independent neurons, indicating a critical role for synaptic interactions and precise timing within and across cell assemblies in place sequence representation.

Here we report that temporal sequences of firing of place cells expressed during a novel spatial experience occurred on a significant number of occasions during the resting or sleeping period preceding the experience.

We investigated the roles that prior experience and hippocampal CA3 \textit{N}-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity play in CA1 place cell sequence encoding and learning during novel spatial experiences. We found that specific representations of de novo experiences on linear environments were formed on a framework of pre configured network activity expressed in the preceding sleep and were rapidly, flexibly adjusted via NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience accelerated encoding of subsequent experiences on contiguous or isolated novel tracks, significantly decreasing their NMDAR-dependence. Similarly, de novo learning of an alternation task was facilitated by CA3 NMDARs; this experience accelerated subsequent learning of related tasks, independent of CA3 NMDARs, consistent with a schema-based learning.

The hippocampus is a brain area necessary for normal internally generated spatial--temporal representations and its dysfunctions have resulted in anterograde amnesia, impaired imagining of new experiences, and hallucinations. The compressed temporal sequence of place cell activity in the rodent hippocampus serves as an animal model of internal representation of the external space.

Their endogenous replay during subsequent sleep is critical for memory consolidation. The present review discusses possible mechanisms and functions of hippocampal theta sequences during exploration.

It is commonly addressed at two complementary levels of description and analysis: the cellular/synaptic level (synaptic consolidation) and the brain systems level (systems consolidation). This article focuses on selected recent advances in consolidation research, including the reconsolidation of long-term memory items, the brain mechanisms of transformation of the content and of cue-dependency of memory items over time, as well as the role of rest and sleep in consolidating and shaping memories. Taken together, the picture that emerges is of dynamic engrams that are formed, modified, and remodified over time at the systems level by using synaptic consolidation mechanisms as subroutines. This implies that, contrary to interpretations that have dominated neuroscience for a while, but similar to long-standing cognitive concepts, consolidation of at least some items in long-term memory may never really come to an end.

We show that decisions made in the context of familiar images are more likely to be influenced by past events than are decisions made in the context of novel images (Experiment 1), that this bias persists even when a temporal gap is introduced between the image presentation and the decision (Experiment 2), and that contextual novelty facilitates value learning whereas familiarity facilitates the retrieval and use of previously learned values (Experiment 3). These effects are consistent with neurobiological and computational models of memory, which propose that familiar images evoke a lingering ``retrieval state'' that facilitates the recollection of other episodic memories. Together, these experiments highlight the importance of episodic memory for decision-making and provide an example of how computational and neurobiological theories can lead to new insights into how and when different types of memories guide our choices.",,,,,,,,,"Duncan, Katherine D and Shohamy, Daphna",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAcLi4vcGFwZXJzL2R1bmNhbjIwMTZqZXBnLnBkZk8RAXQAAAAAAXQAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////xJkdW5jYW4yMDE2amVwZy5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAQS86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6ZHVuY2FuMjAxNmplcGcucGRmAAAOACYAEgBkAHUAbgBjAGEAbgAyADAAMQA2AGoAZQBwAGcALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA/VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvZHVuY2FuMjAxNmplcGcucGRmAAATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABDAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbs=,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 13:20:05 +0100,2021-01-18 13:20:42 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,,,1420,,,,American Psychological Association,,,,,,,,Memory states influence value-based decisions.,,,,,,145,2016,
article,Dunsmoor2015N,"Neurobiological models of long-term memory propose a mechanism by which initially weak memories are strengthened through subsequent activation that engages common neural pathways minutes to hours later1. This synaptic tag-and-capture model has been hypothesized to explain how inconsequential information is selectively consolidated following salient experiences. Behavioural evidence for tag-and-capture is provided by rodent studies in which weak early memories are strengthened by future behavioural training2,3. Whether a process of behavioural tagging occurs in humans to transform weak episodic memories into stable long-term memories is unknown. Here we show, in humans, that information is selectively consolidated if conceptually related information, putatively represented in a common neural substrate, is made salient through an emotional learning experience. Memory for neutral objects was selectively enhanced if other objects from the same category were paired with shock. Retroactive enhancements as a result of emotional learning were observed following a period of consolidation, but were not observed in an immediate memory test or for items strongly encoded before fear conditioning. These findings provide new evidence for a generalized retroactive memory enhancement, whereby inconsequential information can be retroactively credited as relevant, and therefore selectively remembered, if conceptually related information acquires salience in the future.",,,,,,,,,"Dunsmoor, Joseph E. and Murty, Vishnu P. and Davachi, Lila and Phelps, Elizabeth A.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL2R1bnNtb29yMjAxNW4ucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EWR1bnNtb29yMjAxNW4ucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpkdW5zbW9vcjIwMTVuLnBkZgAOACQAEQBkAHUAbgBzAG0AbwBvAHIAMgAwADEANQBuAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2R1bnNtb29yMjAxNW4ucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,2015/04/01,,2021-01-19 10:21:53 +0100,2021-01-19 10:22:16 +0100,,,10.1038/nature14106,,,,,,,,,Dunsmoor2015,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7547,,,345--348,,,,,,,,,,,,Emotional learning selectively and retroactively strengthens memories for related events,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14106,520,2015,

Here, we review emerging evidence on behavioral and neural mechanisms of generalization of emotional learning with the goal of encouraging further research on generalization in anxiety disorders. We begin by placing research on fear generalization in a rich historical context of stimulus generalization dating back to Pavlov, which lays the foundation for theoretical and experimental approaches used today.

We found that remembering newly learnt goal locations required NMDA receptor--dependent stabilization and enhanced reactivation of goal-related hippocampal assemblies. During spatial learning, place-related firing patterns in the CA1, but not CA3, region of the rat hippocampus were reorganized to represent new goal locations. Such reorganization did not occur when goals were marked by visual cues. The stabilization and successful retrieval of these newly acquired CA1 representations of behaviorally relevant places was NMDAR dependent and necessary for subsequent memory retention performance. Goal-related assembly patterns associated with sharp wave/ripple network oscillations, during both learning and subsequent rest periods, predicted memory performance.

Here, we investigate this issue using overnight sleep monitoring and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were exposed to a statistically structured sequence of auditory tones then tested immediately for recognition of short sequences which conformed to the learned statistical pattern. Subsequently, after consolidation over either 30min or 24h, they performed a delayed test session in which brain activity was monitored with fMRI. Behaviorally, there was greater improvement across 24h than across 30min, and this was predicted by the amount of slow wave sleep (SWS) obtained. Functionally, we observed weaker parahippocampal responses and stronger striatal responses after sleep. Like the behavioral result, these differences in functional response were predicted by the amount of SWS obtained. Furthermore, connectivity between striatum and parahippocampus was weaker after sleep, whereas connectivity between putamen and planum temporale was stronger. Taken together, these findings suggest that abstraction is associated with a gradual shift from the hippocampal to the striatal memory system and that this may be mediated by SWS.",,,,,,,,,"Durrant, Simon J. and Cairney, Scott A. and Lewis, Penelope A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-01 13:30:14 +0200,2020-04-01 13:30:35 +0200,,,10.1093/cercor/bhs244,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-3211,,,Cerebral Cortex,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,10,,,2467--2478,,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),,,,,,,,Overnight Consolidation Aids the Transfer of Statistical Knowledge from the Medial Temporal Lobe to the Striatum,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs244,23,2012,
article,Durrant2011N,"The importance of sleep for memory consolidation has been firmly established over the past decade. Recent work has extended this by suggesting that sleep is also critical for the integration of disparate fragments of information into a unified schema, and for the abstraction of underlying rules. The question of which aspects of sleep play a significant role in integration and abstraction is, however, currently unresolved. Here, we examined the role of sleep in abstraction of the implicit probabilistic structure in sequential stimuli using a statistical learning paradigm, and tested for its role in such abstraction by searching for a predictive relationship between the type of sleep obtained and subsequent performance improvements using polysomnography. In our experiments, participants were exposed to a series of tones in a probabilistically determined sequential structure, and subsequently tested for recognition of novel short sequences adhering to this same statistical pattern in both immediate- and delayed-recall sessions. Participants who consolidated over a night of sleep improved significantly more than those who consolidated over an equivalent period of daytime wakefulness. Similarly, participants who consolidated across a 4-h afternoon delay containing a nap improved significantly more than those who consolidated across an equivalent period without a nap. Importantly, polysomnography revealed a significant correlation between the level of improvement and the amount of slow-wave sleep obtained. We also found evidence of a time-based consolidation process which operates alongside sleep-specific consolidation. These results demonstrate that abstraction of statistical patterns benefits from sleep, and provide the first clear support for the role of slow-wave sleep in this consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Durrant, Simon J. and Taylor, Charlotte and Cairney, Scott and Lewis, Penelope A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 13:02:28 +0200,2020-04-15 13:03:39 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.02.015,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-3932,,,Neuropsychologia,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,5,,,1322--1331,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Sleep-dependent consolidation of statistical learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.02.015,49,2011,
article,Durstewitz2010N,"One of the most intriguing aspects of adaptive behavior involves the inference of regularities and rules in ever-changing environments. Rules are often deduced through evidence-based learning which relies on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is a highly dynamic process, evolving trial by trial and therefore may not be adequately captured by averaging single-unit responses over numerous repetitions. Here, we employed advanced statistical techniques to visualize the trajectories of ensembles of simultaneously recorded medial PFC neurons on a trial-by-trial basis as rats deduced a novel rule in a set-shifting task. Neural populations formed clearly distinct and lasting representations of familiar and novel rules by entering unique network states. During rule acquisition, the recorded ensembles often exhibited abrupt transitions, rather than evolving continuously, in tight temporal relation to behavioral performance shifts.

article,Dusek1997PNAS,"Human declarative memory involves a systematic organization of information that supports generalizations and inferences from acquired knowledge. This kind of memory depends on the hippocampal region in humans, but the extent to which animals also have declarative memory, and whether inferential expression of memory depends on the hippocampus in animals, remains a major challenge in cognitive neuroscience. To examine these issues, we used a test of transitive inference pioneered by Piaget to assess capacities for systematic organization of knowledge and logical inference in children. In our adaptation of the test, rats were trained on a set of four overlapping odor discrimination problems that could be encoded either separately or as a single representation of orderly relations among the odor stimuli. Normal rats learned the problems and demonstrated the relational memory organization through appropriate transitive inferences about items not presented together during training. By contrast, after disconnection of the hippocampus from either its cortical or subcortical pathway, rats succeeded in acquiring the separate discrimination problems but did not demonstrate transitive inference, indicating that they had failed to develop or could not inferentially express the orderly organization of the stimulus elements.

article,Duvelle2019JN,"Hippocampal place cells show position-specific activity, thought to reflect a self-localization signal. Several reports also point to some form of goal encoding by place cells. We investigated this by asking whether they also encode the value of spatial goals, which is a crucial information for optimizing goal-directed navigation. We used a continuous place navigation task in which male rats navigate to one of two (freely chosen) unmarked locations and wait, triggering the release of reward which is then located and consumed elsewhere. This allows sampling of place fields, and dissociates spatial goal from reward consumption. The two goals varied in the amount of reward provided, allowing assessment of whether the rats factored goal value into their navigational choice, and of possible neural correlates of this value.Rats successfully learned the task, indicating goal localization, and they preferred higher-value goals, indicating processing of goal value. Replicating previous findings, there was goal-related activity in the out-of-field firing of CA1 place cells, with a ramping-up of firing rate during the waiting period, but no general over-representation of goals by place fields, an observation that we extended to CA3 place cells. Importantly, place cells were not modulated by goal value. This suggests that dorsal hippocampal place cells encode space independently of its associated value, despite the effect of that value on spatial behavior. Our findings are consistent with a model of place cells in which they provide a spontaneously constructed value-free spatial representation, rather than encoding other navigationally relevant, but non-spatial, information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe investigated whether hippocampal place cells, which compute a self-localization signal, also encode the relative value of places, which is essential information for optimal navigation. When choosing between two spatial goals of different value, rats preferred the higher-value goal. We saw out-of-field goal firing in place cells, replicating previous observations that the cells are influenced by the goal, but their activity was not modulated by the value of these goals. Our results suggest that place cells do not encode all of the navigationally relevant aspects of a place, but instead form a value-free {\textquotedblleft}map{\textquotedblright} that links to such aspects in other parts of the brain.",,,,,,,,,"Duvelle, {\'E}l{\'e}onore and Grieves, Roddy M. and Hok, Vincent and Poucet, Bruno and Arleo, Angelo and Jeffery, Kate and Save, Etienne",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 16:52:24 +0100,2020-12-14 16:52:42 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1578-18.2018,,,,,1578-18,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/01/25/JNEUROSCI.1578-18.2018.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Insensitivity of place cells to the value of spatial goals in a two-choice flexible navigation task,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/01/25/JNEUROSCI.1578-18.2018,,2019,

article,Dworkin2020NN,"Similarly to many scientific disciplines, neuroscience has increasingly attempted to confront pervasive gender imbalances. Although publishing and conference participation are often highlighted, recent research has called attention to the prevalence of gender imbalance in citations. Because of the downstream effects of citations on visibility and career advancement, understanding the role of gender in citation practices is vital for addressing scientific inequity. Here, we investigate whether gendered patterns are present in neuroscience citations.

article,Diaz2019S,"The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature's benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend---nature and its contributions to people---is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic, social, and technological causes of nature's deterioration.",,,,,,,,,"D{\'\i}az, Sandra and Settele, Josef and Brond{\'\i}zio, Eduardo S. and Ngo, Hien T. and Agard, John and Arneth, Almut and Balvanera, Patricia and Brauman, Kate A. and Butchart, Stuart H.

article,Eagleman2012PNAS,"In the absence of sensory input, neuronal networks are far from being silent. Whether spontaneous changes in ongoing activity reflect previous sensory experience or stochastic fluctuations in brain activity is not well understood. Here we describe reactivation of stimulus-evoked activity in awake visual cortical networks. We found that continuous exposure to randomly flashed image sequences induces reactivation in macaque V4 cortical networks in the absence of visual stimulation. This reactivation of previously evoked activity is stimulus-specific, occurs only in the same temporal order as the original response, and strengthens with increased stimulus exposures. Importantly, cells exhibiting significant reactivation carry more information about the stimulus than cells that do not reactivate. These results demonstrate a surprising degree of experience-dependent plasticity in visual cortical networks as a result of repeated exposure to unattended information. We suggest that awake reactivation in visual cortex may underlie perceptual learning by passive stimulus exposure.",,,,,,,,,"Eagleman, S.

article,Eckstein2019B,"Humans have the fascinating ability to achieve goals in a complex and constantly changing world, still surpassing modern machine learning algorithms in terms of flexibility and learning speed. It is generally accepted that a crucial factor for this ability is the use of abstract, hierarchical representations, which employ structure in the environment to guide learning and decision making. Nevertheless, it is poorly understood how we create and use these hierarchical representations. This study presents evidence that human behavior can be characterized as hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). We designed an experiment to test specific predictions of hierarchical RL using a series of subtasks in the realm of context-based learning, and observed several behavioral markers of hierarchical RL, for instance asymmetric switch costs between changes in higher-level versus lower-level features, faster learning in higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts, and preference for higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts, which replicated across three samples. We simulated a classic flat and a hierarchical RL model and compared the behaviors of both to humans. As expected, only hierarchical RL reproduced all human behaviors, whereas flat RL was qualitatively unable to show some, and provided worse model fits for the rest. Importantly, individual hierarchical RL simulations showed human-like behaviors in all subtasks simultaneously, providing a unifying account for a diverse range of behaviors. This work shows that hierarchical RL, a biologically-inspired and computationally cheap algorithm, can reproduce human behavior in complex, hierarchical environments, and opens the avenue for future research in this field.",,,,,,,,,"Eckstein, Maria K and Collins, Anne GE",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 12:00:15 +0200,2020-06-11 12:00:46 +0200,,,10.1101/731752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Computational Evidence for Hierarchically-Structured Reinforcement Learning in Humans,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/731752,,2019,

article,Ego-Stengel2010H,"The hippocampus plays a key role in the acquisition of new memories for places and events. Evidence suggests that the consolidation of these memories is enhanced during sleep. At the neuronal level, reactivation of awake experience in the hippocampus during sharp‐wave ripple events, characteristic of slow‐wave sleep, has been proposed as a neural mechanism for sleep‐dependent memory consolidation. However, a causal relation between sleep reactivation and memory consolidation has not been established. Here we show that disrupting neuronal activity during ripple events impairs spatial learning. We trained rats daily in two identical spatial navigation tasks followed each by a 1‐hour rest period. After one of the tasks, stimulation of hippocampal afferents selectively disrupted neuronal activity associated with ripple events without changing the sleep‐wake structure. Rats learned the control task significantly faster than the task followed by rest stimulation, indicating that interfering with hippocampal processing during sleep led to decreased learning.",,,,,,,,,"Ego-Stengel, Val{\'e}rie and Wilson, Matthew A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-10 10:50:56 +0100,2020-04-15 11:24:42 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.20707,,,,,,,,,,,,1098-1063,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1--10,,,,Wiley,,,,,,replay; ripples,,Disruption of ripple-associated hippocampal activity during rest impairs spatial learning in the rat,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.20707,20,2010,
article,Eichenbaum1987JN,"Several techniques previously used to describe behavioral correlates of hippocampal unit and slow-wave activity are combined in a single odor- discrimination paradigm. Rats repetitively performed a sequence of behaviors during each trial: approach to a stimulus-sampling port, investigatory sniffing of the odor cue, orientation and approach toward a separate reward location, and water reward consumption. In a series of post hoc analyses, spike activity was time-locked to variations of each task event to uncover behavioral and physiological parameters that best synchronized unit firing. Three major categories of cells were identified: (1) {\textquotedblleft}Cue-sampling{\textquotedblright} cells fired after onset of odor-cue sampling. Response magnitude was related to cue valence on both the current and past trials. (2) {\textquotedblleft}Goal-approach{\textquotedblright} cells fired prior to arrival at either the odor-sampling port or reward cup. A number of sampling and approach cells also had place correlates. However, detailed analyses indicated that specific behaviors associated with increased firing reliably occurred at the same place. Unit activity was at least as well described by behavioral as spatial parameters. (3) {\textquotedblleft}Theta{\textquotedblright} cells fired at high rates in strict relation to the ongoing limbic theta rhythm. This categorization suggests a functional organization of the hippocampus in which different cell types play complementary roles. Cue-sampling cells activated by discriminative stimuli during attentive fixations may be involved in comparing relative cue valence. Goal-approach cells may be involved in orientation movements for successive cue-sampling periods.

Here, we test for replay in the human brain by recording spiking activity from the motor cortex of two participants who had intracortical microelectrode arrays placed chronically as part of a brain-computer interface pilot clinical trial. Participants took a nap before and after playing a neurally controlled sequence-copying game that consists of many repetitions of one ``repeated'' sequence sparsely interleaved with varying ``control'' sequences. Both participants performed repeated sequences more accurately than control sequences, consistent with learning. We compare the firing rate patterns that caused the cursor movements when performing each sequence to firing rate patterns throughout both rest periods. Correlations with repeated sequences increase more from pre- to post-task rest than do correlations with control sequences, providing direct evidence of learning-related replay in the human brain.",,,,,,,,,"Eichenlaub, Jean-Baptiste and Jarosiewicz, Beata and Saab, Jad and Franco, Brian and Kelemen, Jessica and Halgren, Eric and Hochberg, Leigh R. and Cash, Sydney S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-15 10:40:00 +0100,2020-12-15 10:40:15 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107581,,,,,,,,,,,,2211-1247,,,Cell Reports,,,"memory, replay, learning, consolidation, reactivation, human, motor cortex, microelectrode array, sleep, brain-computer interface",,,,,,,,,,,5,,,107581,,,,,,,,,,,,Replay of Learned Neural Firing Sequences during Rest in Human Motor Cortex,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720305301,31,2020,
article,Ekman2017NC,"Perception is guided by the anticipation of future events. It has been hypothesized that this process may be implemented by pattern completion in early visual cortex, in which a stimulus sequence is recreated after only a subset of the visual input is provided. Here we test this hypothesis using ultra-fast functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure BOLD activity at precisely defined receptive field locations in visual cortex (V1) of human volunteers. We find that after familiarizing subjects with a spatial sequence, flashing only the starting point of the sequence triggers an activity wave in V1 that resembles the full stimulus sequence. This preplay activity is temporally compressed compared to the actual stimulus sequence and remains present even when attention is diverted from the stimulus sequence.

article,Ekstrom2001N,"In agreement with theories of sequence learning, hippocampal place representations expand asymmetrically during repeated route following. This behaviorally induced, experience-dependent expression of neuronal plasticity was blocked by the NMDAR antagonist CPP, suggesting that it may result from the temporal asymmetry and associative properties of LTP. NMDAR antagonism, however, had no effect on the range of the progressive shift of firing phase of hippocampal cells, relative to the theta rhythm, as the rat traverses the cell's ``place field.'' Thus, when place fields normally expand with experience, the relationship between firing phase and position is altered, as predicted by models that account for ``phase precession'' on the basis of asymmetry of synaptic connection strengths. These effects of CPP mimic changes that occur during normal aging, suggesting mechanisms by which sequence learning deficits may arise in aged animals.",,,,,,,,,"Ekstrom, A.D. and Meltzer, J. and McNaughton, B.L. and Barnes, C.A.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAaLi4vcGFwZXJzL2Vrc3Ryb20yMDAxbi5wZGZPEQFsAAAAAAFsAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8QZWtzdHJvbTIwMDFuLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAD8vOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOmVrc3Ryb20yMDAxbi5wZGYAAA4AIgAQAGUAawBzAHQAcgBvAG0AMgAwADAAMQBuAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPVVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2Vrc3Ryb20yMDAxbi5wZGYAABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEEAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABsQ==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-18 09:46:14 +0100,2020-12-18 09:46:59 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00401-9,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,631 - 638,,,,,,,,,,,,NMDA Receptor Antagonism Blocks Experience-Dependent Expansion of Hippocampal ``Place Fields'',,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301004019,31,2001,
article,Ekstrom2003N,"Place cells of the rodent hippocampus constitute one of the most striking examples of a correlation between neuronal activity and complex behaviour in mammals. These cells increase their firing rates when the animal traverses specific regions of its surroundings, providing a context-dependent map of the environment. Neuroimaging studies implicate the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region in human navigation. However, these regions also respond selectively to visual stimuli. It thus remains unclear whether rodent place coding has a homologue in humans or whether human navigation is driven by a different, visually based neural mechanism. We directly recorded from 317 neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobes while subjects explored and navigated a virtual town. Here we present evidence for a neural code of human spatial navigation based on cells that respond at specific spatial locations and cells that respond to views of landmarks. The former are present primarily in the hippocampus, and the latter in the parahippocampal region.

article,Eldar2018NHB,"When confronted with complex inputs consisting of multiple elements, humans use various strategies to integrate the elements quickly and accurately. For instance, accuracy may be improved by processing elements one at a time or over extended periods; speed can increase if the internal representation of elements is accelerated. However, little is known about how humans actually approach these challenges because behavioural findings can be accounted for by multiple alternative process models and neuroimaging investigations typically rely on haemodynamic signals that change too slowly. Consequently, to uncover the fast neural dynamics that support information integration, we decoded magnetoencephalographic signals that were recorded as human subjects performed a complex decision task. Our findings reveal three sources of individual differences in the temporal structure of the integration process---sequential representation, partial reinstatement and early computation---each having a dissociable effect on how subjects handled problem complexity and temporal constraints.

article,Ellenbogen2007PNAS,"Relational memory, the flexible ability to generalize across existing stores of information, is a fundamental property of human cognition. Little is known, however, about how and when this inferential knowledge emerges. Here, we test the hypothesis that human relational memory develops during offline time periods. Fifty-six participants initially learned five {\textquotedblleft}premise pairs{\textquotedblright} (A\&gt;B, B\&gt;C, C\&gt;D, D\&gt;E, and E\&gt;F). Unknown to subjects, the pairs contained an embedded hierarchy (A\&gt;B\&gt;C\&gt;D\&gt;E\&gt;F). Following an offline delay of either 20 min, 12 hr (wake or sleep), or 24 hr, knowledge of the hierarchy was tested by examining inferential judgments for novel {\textquotedblleft}inference pairs{\textquotedblright} (B\&gt;D, C\&gt;E, and B\&gt;E). Despite all groups achieving near-identical premise pair retention after the offline delay (all groups, \&gt;85\%; the building blocks of the hierarchy), a striking dissociation was evident in the ability to make relational inference judgments: the 20-min group showed no evidence of inferential ability (52\%), whereas the 12- and 24-hr groups displayed highly significant relational memory developments (inference ability of both groups, \&gt;75\%; P \&lt; 0.001). Moreover, if the 12-hr period contained sleep, an additional boost to relational memory was seen for the most distant inferential judgment (the B\&gt;E pair; sleep = 93\%, wake = 69\%, P = 0.03). Interestingly, despite this increase in performance, the sleep benefit was not associated with an increase in subjective confidence for these judgments. Together, these findings demonstrate that human relational memory develops during offline time delays. Furthermore, sleep appears to preferentially facilitate this process by enhancing hierarchical memory binding, thereby allowing superior performance for the more distant inferential judgments, a benefit that may operate below the level of conscious awareness.",,,,,,,,,"Ellenbogen, Jeffrey M. and Hu, Peter T. and Payne, Jessica D. and Titone, Debra and Walker, Matthew P.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 13:55:44 +0100,2020-11-30 13:56:21 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.0700094104,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7723.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,,,7723--7728,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,statistical learning,,Human relational memory requires time and sleep,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7723,104,2007,
article,Elliott2020N,"The prioritized encoding and retrieval of valuable information is an essential aspect of human memory. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine which of two hypothesized processes underlies the influence of reward value on episodic memory. One hypothesis is that value engages prefrontal executive control processes, so that valuable stimuli engage an elaborative rehearsal strategy that benefits memory. A second hypothesis is that value acts through the reward-related midbrain dopamine system to modulate synaptic plasticity in hippocampal and cortical efferents, thereby benefiting memory encoding. We used a value-directed recognition memory (VDR) paradigm in which participants encoded words assigned different point values and aimed to maximize the point value of subsequently recognized words. Subjective states of recollection (i.e., ``remember'') and familiarity (i.e., ``know'') were assessed at retrieval. Words assigned higher values at study were recognized more effectively than words assigned lower values, due to increased ``remember'' responses but no difference in ``know'' responses. Greater value was also associated with larger amplitudes of an EEG component at retrieval that indexes recollection (parietal old/new component), but had no relationship with a component that indexes familiarity (FN400 component). During encoding, we assessed a late frontal positivity (frontal slow wave, FSW) that has been related to elaborative rehearsal strategies and an early parietal component (P3) thought to index dopamine driven attention allocation. Our findings indicate that the effect of value on recognition memory is primarily driven by the dopamine-driven reward valuation system (P3) with no discernible effect on rehearsal processes (FSW).",,,,,,,,,"Elliott, Blake L. and Blais, Chris and McClure, Samuel M. and Brewer, Gene A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-19 16:26:06 +0100,2021-01-19 16:26:24 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116296,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,116296,,,,,,,,,,,,Neural correlates underlying the effect of reward value on recognition memory,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919308870,206,2020,

By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top--down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process.

Here we review recent work that suggests a similar functional organization in the human brain and yields insights into how cognitive maps are used during spatial navigation. Specifically, these studies indicate that (i) the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support map-like spatial codes, (ii) posterior brain regions such as parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices provide critical inputs that allow cognitive maps to be anchored to fixed environmental landmarks, and (iii) hippocampal and entorhinal spatial codes are used in conjunction with frontal lobe mechanisms to plan routes during navigation.

article,Epstein2012N,"Human observers can recognize real-world visual scenes with great efficiency. Cortical regions such as the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial complex (RSC) have been implicated in scene recognition, but the specific representations supported by these regions are largely unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation (fMRIa) and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to explore this issue, focusing on whether the PPA and RSC represent scenes in terms of general categories, or as specific scenic exemplars. Subjects were scanned while viewing images drawn from 10 outdoor scene categories in two scan runs and images of 10 familiar landmarks from their home college campus in two scan runs. Analyses of multi-voxel patterns revealed that the PPA and RSC encoded both category and landmark information, with a slight advantage for landmark coding in RSC. fMRIa, on the other hand, revealed a very different picture: both PPA and RSC adapted when landmark information was repeated, but category adaptation was only observed in a small subregion of the left PPA. These inconsistencies between the MVPA and fMRIa data suggests that these two techniques interrogate different aspects of the neuronal code.

article,Epsztein2011N,"For each environment a rodent has explored, its hippocampus contains a map consisting of a unique subset of neurons, called place cells, that have spatially tuned spiking there, with the remaining neurons being essentially silent. Using whole-cell recording in freely moving rats exploring a novel maze, we observed differences in intrinsic cellular properties and input-based subthreshold membrane potential levels underlying this division into place and silent cells. Compared to silent cells, place cells had lower spike thresholds and peaked versus flat subthreshold membrane potentials as a function of animal location. Both differences were evident from the beginning of exploration. Additionally, future place cells exhibited higher burst propensity before exploration. Thus, internal settings appear to predetermine which cells will represent the next novel environment encountered. Furthermore, place cells fired spatially tuned bursts with large, putatively calcium-mediated depolarizations that could trigger plasticity and stabilize the new map for long-term storage.

article,Erdem2012EJN,"A goal-directed navigation model is proposed based on forward linear look-ahead probe of trajectories in a network of head direction cells, grid cells, place cells and prefrontal cortex (PFC) cells. The model allows selection of new goal-directed trajectories. In a novel environment, the virtual rat incrementally creates a map composed of place cells and PFC cells by random exploration. After exploration, the rat retrieves memory of the goal location, picks its next movement direction by forward linear look-ahead probe of trajectories in several candidate directions while stationary in one location, and finds the one activating PFC cells with the highest reward signal. Each probe direction involves activation of a static pattern of head direction cells to drive an interference model of grid cells to update their phases in a specific direction. The updating of grid cell spiking drives place cells along the probed look-ahead trajectory similar to the forward replay during waking seen in place cell recordings. Directions are probed until the look-ahead trajectory activates the reward signal and the corresponding direction is used to guide goal-finding behavior. We report simulation results in several mazes with and without barriers. Navigation with barriers requires a PFC map topology based on the temporal vicinity of visited place cells and a reward signal diffusion process. The interaction of the forward linear look-ahead trajectory probes with the reward diffusion allows discovery of never-before experienced shortcuts towards a goal location.",,,,,,,,,"Erdem, U{\u g}ur M. and Hasselmo, Michael",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-27 12:32:06 +0100,2020-11-27 12:33:29 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08015.x,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08015.x,,,,,,,,,European Journal of Neuroscience,,,"grid cell, hippocampus, navigation, place cell, prefrontal cortex",,,,,,,,,,,6,,,916-931,,,,,,,,,,,,A goal-directed spatial navigation model using forward trajectory planning based on grid cells,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08015.x,35,2012,

article,Ergo2020TCS,"The concept of reward prediction error (RPE) learning has been extremely influential in the nondeclarative memory literature, but the role of RPEs in declarative memory has only recently begun to be explored. Two main approaches to measure RPE in declarative memory have been developed. In the reward-prediction approach, reward is iteratively sampled by the experimenter from a statistical distribution and predicted by the subject. In the multiple-repetition approach, subjects see the same memoranda repeatedly and estimate their probability of success. Behaviorally, the reward-prediction approach has mainly yielded signed RPE signatures, whereas the multiple-repetition paradigm has mainly yielded unsigned RPE signatures. However, there are exceptions, and neural (electroencephalography, fMRI) paradigms have yielded both in single studies. An RPE perspective provides testable hypotheses on why reward and reward prediction manipulations may improve or impair declarative learning. Learning based on reward prediction error (RPE) was originally proposed in the context of nondeclarative memory. We postulate that RPE may support declarative memory as well. Indeed, recent years have witnessed a number of independent empirical studies reporting effects of RPE on declarative memory. We provide a brief overview of these studies, identify emerging patterns, and discuss open issues such as the role of signed versus unsigned RPEs in declarative learning.",,,,,,,,,"Ergo, Kate and De Loof, Esther and Verguts, Tom",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-19 10:56:03 +0100,2020-12-14 15:46:07 +0100,,,10.1016/j.tics.2020.02.009,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6613,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,koenigsberg,,Reward Prediction Error and Declarative Memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.02.009,,2020,
article,Ernst1966RSI,The application of a new Fourier transform technique to magnetic resonance spectroscopy is explored. The method consists of applying a sequence of short rf pulses to the sample to be investigated and Fourier‐transforming the response of the system. The main advantages of this technique compared with the usual spectral sweep method are the much shorter time required to record a spectrum and the higher inherent sensitivity. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that it is possible to enhance the sensitivity of high resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a restricted time up to a factor of ten or more. The time necessary to achieve the same sensitivity is a factor of 100 shorter than with conventional methods.

article,Esteban2017P,"Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76%$\pm$13% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N = 265) also obtaining a 76% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.",,,,,,,,,"Esteban, Oscar and Birman, Daniel and Schaer, Marie and Koyejo, Oluwasanmi O. and Poldrack, Russell A. and Gorgolewski, Krzysztof J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-06 17:13:47 +0100,2020-11-24 09:36:59 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0184661,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,Sep,,,9,,,e0184661,,,,Public Library of Science (PLoS),,,,,,,,{MRIQC}: Advancing the automatic prediction of image quality in {MRI} from unseen sites,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184661,12,2017,

article,Etzel2011N,"Multivoxel pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is continuing to increase in popularity. Like all fMRI analyses, these analyses require extensive data processing and methodological choices, but the impact of these decisions on the final results is not always known. This study explores the impact of four methodological choices on analysis outcomes and introduces the technique of partitioning on random runs for characterizing temporal dependencies and evaluating partitioning methods. The analyses were performed on two fMRI data sets, which were repeatedly analyzed with support vector machines, varying the method of temporal compression, smoothing, voxel-wise detrending, and partitioning into training and testing sets. Smoothing sometimes slightly increased classification accuracy. Partitioning other than on the runs increased classification accuracy, and the random runs technique allowed us to attribute this improvement to the increased amount of training data, rather than to bias. The impact of the temporal compression and detrending methods varied so strongly with data set that general recommendations could not be drawn. These interactions suggest that, rather than searching for a universally superior set of methodological choices, researchers must carefully consider each choice in the context of each experiment.",,,,,,,,,"Etzel, Joset A. and Valchev, Nikola and Keysers, Christian",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 13:25:36 +0200,2020-07-20 14:46:07 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.050,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,2,,,1159--1167,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,The impact of certain methodological choices on multivariate analysis of {fMRI} data with support vector machines,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.050,54,2011,

article,Euston2012N,"Some have claimed that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates decision making. Others suggest mPFC is selectively involved in the retrieval of remote long-term memory. Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time.

article,Euston2006JN,"Simple sequences can be represented via asymmetrically linked neural assemblies, provided that the elements of the sequence are unique. When elements repeat, however (e.g., A-B-C-B-A), the same element belongs to two separate {\textquotedblleft}sequential contexts,{\textquotedblright} and a more complex encoding mechanism is required. To enable correct sequence performance, some neural structure must provide a disambiguating signal that differentiates the two sequential contexts (i.e., B as an element of {\textquotedblleft}A-B{\textquotedblright} as opposed to {\textquotedblleft}C-B{\textquotedblright}). The disambiguating signal may derive from a form of working memory, or, in some cases, a simple timing mechanism may suffice. To investigate the possible role of medial prefrontal cortex in complex sequence encoding, rats were trained on a spatial sequence containing two adjacent repeated segments (e.g., A-B-C-D-B-C-E). The double-repeat procedure minimized behavioral differences in the second leg (C) of the repeat subsequence that arise in the first leg (B) because of differences in the entry point (e.g., A-B vs D-B). Far more cells were context sensitive along the first leg than along the second (36 vs 9\%), and most of the differences were accounted for by systematic variations in the rat{\textquoteright}s trajectory, which were much larger along the first leg. There is thus little evidence for sequential context-discriminative activity in the medial prefrontal cortex that cannot plausibly be accounted for by context-dependent behavior. The finding that the rodent medial prefrontal cortex is highly sensitive to sensory{\textendash}behavioral variables raises doubts about previous experiments that purport to show working memory-related activity in this region.",,,,,,,,,"Euston, David R. and McNaughton, Bruce L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 09:41:23 +0100,2020-12-14 09:41:48 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3803-06.2006,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/51/13143.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51,,,13143--13155,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Apparent Encoding of Sequential Context in Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex Is Accounted for by Behavioral Variability,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/51/13143,26,2006,
article,Evans2019ANIPS,"Constructing and maintaining useful representations of sensory experience is essential for reasoning about ones environment. High-level associative (topological) maps can be useful for efficient planning and are easily constructed from experience. Conversely, embedding new experiences within a metric structure allows them to be integrated with existing ones and novel associations to be implicitly inferred. Neurobiologically, the synaptic associations between hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells are thought to represent associative and metric structures, respectively. Learning the place-grid cell associations can therefore be interpreted as learning a mapping between these two spaces.

article,Evans2020B,"Model-based decision making relies on the construction of an accurate representation of the underlying state-space, and localization of one's current state within it. One way to localize is to recognize the state with which incoming sensory observations have been previously associated. Another is to update a previous state estimate given a known transition. In practice, both strategies are subject to uncertainty and must be balanced with respect to their relative confidences; robust learning requires aligning the predictions of both models over historic observations. Here, we propose a dual-systems account of the hippocampal-entorhinal system, where sensory prediction errors between these models during online exploration of state space initiate offline probabilistic inference. Offline inference computes a metric embedding on grid cells of an associative place graph encoded in the recurrent connections between place cells, achieved by message passing between cells representing non-local states. We provide testable explanations for coordinated place and grid cell 'replay' as efficient message passing, and for distortions, partial rescaling and direction-dependent offsets in grid patterns as the confidence weighted balancing of model priors, and distortions to grid patterns as reflecting inhomogeneous sensory inputs across states.",,,,,,,,,"Evans, Talfan and Burgess, Neil",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-10 10:11:26 +0200,2020-08-10 11:05:21 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.08.07.241547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Replay as structural inference in the hippocampal-entorhinal system,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.241547,,2020,
article,Ezzyat2011PS," The idea of episodic memory implies the existence of a process that segments experience into episodes so that they can be stored in memory. It is therefore surprising that the link between event segmentation and the organization of experiences into episodes in memory has not been addressed. We found that after participants read narratives containing temporal event boundaries at varying locations in the narrative, their long-term associative memory for information across event boundaries was lower than their memory for information within an event. This suggests that event segmentation during encoding resulted in segmentation of those same events in memory. Further, functional imaging data revealed that, across participants, brain activity consistent with the ongoing integration of information within events correlated with this pattern of mnemonic segmentation. These data are the first to address the mechanisms that support the organization of experiences into episodes in long-term memory.

article,Farooq2019S,"During memory formation, time-compressed neuronal sequences underlie consolidation as well as encoding of novel information.

This preconfiguration was expressed spontaneously during sleep and emerged from the assembly of persistent, location-depicting ensembles, largely controlled by intrinsic developmental programs. Thus, the compressed binding of adjacent locations into spatial trajectories during navigation and their experience-dependent replay emerge in coordination from spontaneous preconfigured sequences.Science, this issue p. 168When and how hippocampal neuronal ensembles first organize to support encoding and consolidation of memory episodes, a critical cognitive function of the brain, are unknown.

article,Farooq2019N,"A central goal in learning and memory research is to reveal the neural substrates underlying episodic memory formation. The hallmark of sequential spatial trajectory learning, a model of episodic memory, has remained equivocal, with proposals ranging from de novo creation of compressed sequential replay from blank slate networks to selection of pre-existing compressed preplay sequences. Here, we show that increased millisecond-timescale activation of cell assemblies expressed during de novo sequential experience and increased neuronal firing rate correlations can explain the difference between post-experience trajectory replay and robust preplay. This increased activation results from an improved neuronal tuning to specific cell assemblies, higher recruitment of experience-tuned neurons into pre-existing cell assemblies, and increased recruitment of cell assemblies in replay. In contrast, changes in overall neuronal and cell assembly temporal order within extended sequences do not account for sequential trajectory learning. We propose the coordinated strengthening of cell assemblies played sequentially on robust pre-existing temporal frameworks could support rapid formation of episodic-like memory.",,,,,,,,,"Farooq, Usman and Sibille, Jeremie and Liu, Kefei and Dragoi, George",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 18:37:02 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.040,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,4,,,719--733.e7,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Strengthened Temporal Coordination within Pre-existing Sequential Cell Assemblies Supports Trajectory Replay,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.040,103,2019,

However, there is limited empirical evidence linking representational overlap in the hippocampus to memory interference. Likewise, it is not fully understood how learning influences overlap among hippocampal representations. Using pattern-based fMRI analyses, we tested for a bidirectional relationship between memory overlap in the human hippocampus and learning. First, we show that learning drives hippocampal representations of similar events apart from one another. These changes are not explained by task demands to discriminate similar stimuli and are fully absent in visual cortical areas that feed into the hippocampus. Second, we show that lower representational overlap in the hippocampus benefits subsequent learning by preventing interference between similar memories.

Unsupervised learning of these higher-order statistics provides support for Barlow's theory of visual recognition, which posits that detecting ``suspicious coincidences'' of elements during recognition is a necessary prerequisite for efficient learning of new visual features.",,,,,,,,,"Fiser, J{\'o}zsef and Aslin, Richard N.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-01 12:32:05 +0200,2020-04-01 12:32:27 +0200,,,10.1111/1467-9280.00392,,,,,,,,,,,,1467-9280,,,Psychological Science,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,6,,,499--504,,,,SAGE Publications,,,,,,statistical learning,,Unsupervised Statistical Learning of Higher-Order Spatial Structures from Visual Scenes,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00392,12,2001,
article,Fiser2002JEPLMC,"In 3 experiments, the authors investigated the ability of observers to extract the probabilities of successive shape co-occurrences during passive viewing. Participants became sensitive to several temporal-order statistics, both rapidly and with no overt task or explicit instructions. Sequences of shapes presented during familiarization were distinguished from novel sequences of familiar shapes, as well as from shape sequences that were seen during familiarization but less frequently than other shape sequences, demonstrating at least the extraction of joint probabilities of 2 consecutive shapes. When joint probabilities did not differ, another higher-order statistic (conditional probability) was automatically computed, thereby allowing participants to predict the temporal order of shapes. Results of a single-shape test documented that lower-order statistics were retained during the extraction of higher-order statistics.

article,Flesch2018PNAS,"Humans learn to perform many different tasks over the lifespan, such as speaking both French and Spanish. The brain has to represent task information without mutual interference. In machine learning, this {\textquotedblleft}continual learning{\textquotedblright} is a major unsolved challenge. Here, we studied the patterns of errors made by humans and state-of-the-art neural networks while they learned new tasks from scratch and without instruction. Humans, but not machines, seem to benefit from training regimes that blocked one task at a time, especially when they had a prior bias to represent stimuli in a way that encouraged task separation. Machines trained to exhibit the same prior bias suffered less interference between tasks, suggesting new avenues for solving continual learning in artificial systems.Humans can learn to perform multiple tasks in succession over the lifespan ({\textquotedblleft}continual{\textquotedblright} learning), whereas current machine learning systems fail. Here, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms that permit successful continual learning in humans and harnessed our behavioral findings for neural network design. Humans categorized naturalistic images of trees according to one of two orthogonal task rules that were learned by trial and error. Training regimes that focused on individual rules for prolonged periods (blocked training) improved human performance on a later test involving randomly interleaved rules, compared with control regimes that trained in an interleaved fashion. Analysis of human error patterns suggested that blocked training encouraged humans to form {\textquotedblleft}factorized{\textquotedblright} representation that optimally segregated the tasks, especially for those individuals with a strong prior bias to represent the stimulus space in a well-structured way. By contrast, standard supervised deep neural networks trained on the same tasks suffered catastrophic forgetting under blocked training, due to representational interference in the deeper layers. However, augmenting deep networks with an unsupervised generative model that allowed it to first learn a good embedding of the stimulus space (similar to that observed in humans) reduced catastrophic forgetting under blocked training. Building artificial agents that first learn a model of the world may be one promising route to solving continual task performance in artificial intelligence research.",,,,,,,,,"Flesch, Timo and Balaguer, Jan and Dekker, Ronald and Nili, Hamed and Summerfield, Christopher",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 13:27:49 +0100,2020-10-29 13:28:12 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1800755115,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/E10313.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44,,,E10313--E10322,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Comparing continual task learning in minds and machines,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/E10313,115,2018,

Plasticity mechanisms allow the hippocampus to store learned sequences of locations that may allow predictions of future locations based on past experience.

article,Foster2000H,"This paper presents a model of how hippocampal place cells might be used for spatial navigation in two watermaze tasks: the standard reference memory task and a delayed matching‐to‐place task. In the reference memory task, the escape platform occupies a single location and rats gradually learn relatively direct paths to the goal over the course of days, in each of which they perform a fixed number of trials. In the delayed matching‐to‐place task, the escape platform occupies a novel location on each day, and rats gradually acquire one‐trial learning, i.e., direct paths on the second trial of each day. The model uses a local, incremental, and statistically efficient connectionist algorithm called temporal difference learning in two distinct components. The first is a reinforcement‐based ``actor‐critic'' network that is a general model of classical and instrumental conditioning. In this case, it is applied to navigation, using place cells to provide information about state. By itself, the actor‐critic can learn the reference memory task, but this learning is inflexible to changes to the platform location. We argue that one‐trial learning in the delayed matching‐to‐place task demands a goal‐independent representation of space. This is provided by the second component of the model: a network that uses temporal difference learning and self‐motion information to acquire consistent spatial coordinates in the environment. Each component of the model is necessary at a different stage of the task; the actor‐critic provides a way of transferring control to the component that performs best. The model successfully captures gradual acquisition in both tasks, and, in particular, the ultimate development of one‐trial learning in the delayed matching‐to‐place task. Place cells report a form of stable, allocentric information that is well‐suited to the various kinds of learning in the model.

article,Foster2006N,"The hippocampus has long been known to be involved in spatial navigational learning in rodents, and in memory for events in rodents, primates and humans. A unifying property of both navigation and event memory is a requirement for dealing with temporally sequenced information. Reactivation of temporally sequenced memories for previous behavioural experiences has been reported in sleep in rats. Here we report that sequential replay occurs in the rat hippocampus during awake periods immediately after spatial experience.

article,Foster2007H,"The activity of individual hippocampal principal neurons is spatially localized such that each neuron is active only when the animal occupies an area of the environment known as the cell's place field. Additionally, the activity of hippocampal neurons exhibits a particular temporal relationship to the hippocampal EEG, such that spikes fired by the neuron occur at progressively earlier phases of the co-occurring theta rhythm in the EEG as the animal traverses the place field. This relationship is known as theta precession. A long-standing prediction following the observation of theta precession has been that among a collection of hippocampal neurons recorded simultaneously, the neurons will fire in sequences reflecting the behavioral order of the place fields. Here we examine this prediction. We show that clear, ordered sequences occur during theta, which we name theta sequences, in which a portion of the animal's spatial experience is played out in forwards order. We further investigate the relationship of theta sequences to phase precession by shuffling spike phases in such a way as to preserve the relationship between spike phase and position. This jitter significantly reduces the prevalence of theta sequences while leaving theta phase precession intact, suggesting that the presence of theta phase precession is not trivially predictive of theta sequences. Finally, we discuss the relationship between theta sequences and individual place fields, and the possible functional role of theta sequences in navigational learning. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,,,,,,,,"Foster, David J. and Wilson, Matthew A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-18 14:06:05 +0100,2020-12-30 17:32:11 +0100,,,10.1002/hipo.20345,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.20345,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"place cells, memory, theta precession, navigation, replay",,,,,,,,,,,11,,,1093-1099,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampal theta sequences,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.20345,17,2007,
article,Frank2020B,"Expectation violation has been shown to engage adaptive memory formation, resulting in better memory for unexpected information. In two experiments we tested whether this mechanism is engaged dynamically in a goal-irrelevant manner during retrieval, and how it affects trial-by-trial recognition. Participants encoded images of objects, and then learned a contingency between a cue and category (man-made or natural) with new objects. Targets and parametrically manipulated similar foils, comprising set events, were used at retrieval. In each retrieval trial a cue appeared, which either matched or mismatched (according to the established contingency) the following object, for which participants made an old/new decision. We found that unexpected events at retrieval were associated with increased activation along the ventral visual stream, whereas expected events engaged parietal regions of the core recollection network. For targets and most similar foils, we found an interaction between current and previous expectation status on memory performance, such that expected events following unexpected ones (UprevEcurr) showed a boost in performance. This behavioural effect was associated with activation in the hippocampus, SN/VTA and occipital cortex. A combination of two unexpected events (UprevUcurr) resulted in the poorest memory performance and was associated with increased activation in occipital cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest expectation violation engages an encoding mechanism, supported by bottom-up processing, in a task-independent manner. Therefore, when the goal is to retrieve information, the mnemonic consequences of the shift towards an encoding state is detrimental in real-time, but beneficial for subsequent similar events.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Frank, Darya and Kafkas, Alex and Montaldi, Daniela",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 12:46:10 +0100,2021-01-27 12:46:37 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.15.422817,,,,,2020.12.15.422817,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/15/2020.12.15.422817.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Expectation violation dynamically engages a bottom-up encoding state,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/15/2020.12.15.422817,,2020,
article,Frank2004JN,"The hippocampus is essential for learning complex spatial relationships, but little is known about how hippocampal neural activity changes as animals learn about a novel environment. We studied the formation of new place representations in rats by examining the changes in place-specific firing of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the relationship between these changes and behavioral change across multiple days of exposure to novel places. We found that many neurons showed very rapid changes on the first day of exposure to the novel place, including many cases in which a previously silent neuron developed a place field over the course of a single pass through the environment. Across the population, the largest changes in neural activity occurred on day 2 of exposure to a novel place, but only if the animal had little experience (<4 min) in that location on day 1. Longer exposures on day 1 were associated with smaller changes on day 2, suggesting that hippocampal neurons required 5-6 min of experience to form a stable spatial representation. Even after the representation stabilized, the animals' behavior remained different in the novel places, suggesting that other brain regions continued to distinguish novel from familiar locations. These results show that the hippocampus can form new spatial representations quickly but that stable hippocampal representations are not sufficient for a place to be treated as familiar.",,,,,,,,,"Frank, L.

article,Frankland2005NRN,"In humans, damage to the medial temporal lobe typically produces temporally-graded retrograde amnesia ---a loss of recent memories, but a relative sparing of more remote ones. This has been taken as evidence that the hippocampus has a time-limited role in the storage and retrieval of some forms of memory. This idea forms the central tenet of most contemporary views of system consolidation: the hippocampus acts as a temporary store for new information, but permanent storage depends on a broadly distributed cortical network.The relationship between hippocampal damage and retrograde amnesia has been studied in animal models. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows retrograde amnesia to be studied in a prospective manner ---the extent of the lesion can be controlled, as can what is learned and when. As in humans, the typical finding is that disrupting hippocampal function preferentially affects recent, rather than remote, memories.These observations in humans and animal models indicate that memories are reorganized at the system level as they mature. Most contemporary models propose that experience is initially encoded in parallel in hippocampal and cortical networks. Subsequent reactivation of the hippocampal network reinstates activity in different cortical networks. This coordinated replay across hippocampal--cortical networks leads to gradual strengthening of cortico-cortical connections, which eventually allows new memories to become independent of the hippocampus and to be gradually integrated with pre-existing cortical memories.By contrast, multiple trace theory proposes a more permanent role for the hippocampus in some forms of declarative memory. It posits that memories are encoded in hippocampal--cortical networks, and that retrieval of contextually rich episodic memories, as well as spatial detail, always requires the hippocampus.Memory reactivation is the core mechanism in consolidation models. Reactivation of the hippocampal memory trace is thought to lead to the reinstatement of waking patterns of neural activity in the cortex, and subsequent stabilization and refinement of hippocampal--cortical circuits.Gradual remodelling of hippocampal--cortical circuits depends on several rounds of synaptic modification. These changes are initiated in a reactivation-dependent manner, either during online (task-relevant) or offline (sleep or quiet wakefulness) situations, and require the expression of new genes.Imaging studies in rodents have been able to characterize how circuits supporting memories are gradually reorganized over time, to identify sites of permanent storage in the cortex, and to provide evidence for network reorganization at both regional and sub-regional levels. Imaging and pharmacological and anatomical lesion studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as playing a crucial part in processing remote memories.These findings indicate that the prefrontal cortex might have a dual role during recall of remote memories. First, the prefrontal cortex may be important for integrating information from many cortical modules. Second, in the case of successful recall, the prefrontal cortex may exert top-down inhibitory control over hippocampal function to minimize re-encoding of redundant information.",,,,,,,,,"Frankland, Paul W. and Bontempi, Bruno",,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,,,,,,,,,2005/02/01,,2020-11-02 07:50:18 +0100,2020-11-02 07:50:44 +0100,,,10.1038/nrn1607,,,,,,,,,Frankland2005,,1471-0048,,,,Nature Reviews Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,119--130,,,,,,,,,,,,The organization of recent and remote memories,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1607,6,2005,

While ecphory has been examined in human cognitive neuroscience research, its neurobiological foundation is less understood. To the extent that ecphory involves `reawakening' of engrams, leveraging recently developed technologies that can identify and manipulate engrams in rodents provides a fertile avenue for examining retrieval at the level of neuronal ensembles. Here we evaluate emerging neuroscientific research of this type, using cognitive theory as a guiding principle to organize and interpret initial findings. Our Review highlights the critical interaction between engrams and retrieval cues (environmental or artificial) for memory accessibility and retrieval success. These findings also highlight the intimate relationship between the mechanisms important in forming engrams and those important in their recovery, as captured in the cognitive notion of `encoding specificity'.

Sociologists, however, have been largely absent from these discussions. The goals of this review are to introduce sociologists to these developments, synthesize insights from science studies about replication in general, and detail the specific issues regarding replication that occur in sociology. The first half of the article argues that a sociologically sophisticated understanding of replication must address both the ways that replication rules and conventions evolved within an epistemic culture and how those cultures are shaped by specific research challenges. The second half outlines the four main dimensions of replicability in quantitative sociology---verifiability, robustness, repeatability, and generalizability---and discusses the specific ambiguities of interpretation that can arise in each.

article,French1999TCS,"All natural cognitive systems, and, in particular, our own, gradually forget previously learned information. Plausible models of human cognition should therefore exhibit similar patterns of gradual forgetting of old information as new information is acquired. Only rarely does new learning in natural cognitive systems completely disrupt or erase previously learned information; that is, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget `catastrophically'. Unfortunately, though, catastrophic forgetting does occur under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. The very features that give these networks their remarkable abilities to generalize, to function in the presence of degraded input, and so on, are found to be the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge in this field is to discover how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this article the causes, consequences and numerous solutions to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks are examined. The review will consider how the brain might have overcome this problem and will also explore the consequences of this solution for distributed connectionist networks.",,,,,,,,,"French, R",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL2ZyZW5jaDE5OTl0Y3MucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EWZyZW5jaDE5OTl0Y3MucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpmcmVuY2gxOTk5dGNzLnBkZgAOACQAEQBmAHIAZQBuAGMAaAAxADkAOQA5AHQAYwBzAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2ZyZW5jaDE5OTl0Y3MucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-22 15:50:35 +0200,2020-10-22 16:04:31 +0200,,,10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01294-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,128--135,,,,Elsevier {BV},,,,,,,,Catastrophic forgetting in connectionist networks,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01294-2,3,1999,
article,Frey1990BR,"The involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in the induction and maintenance of posttetanic long-term potentiation (LTP) was investigated on CA1 cells of rat hippocampal slices. The presence of the dopamine receptor blocker domperidone in a concentration of 1 μM during tetanization with 3 trains of 100 impulses (100 Hz) and a train interval of 10 min influences neither the synaptic transmission nor the induction of LTP. However, the potentiation of both the population spike and the population EPSP gradually decreases, thus significantly differing from control LTP about 4 h after initiation and reaching the level of non-tetanized controls about 7--8 after tetanization. The simultaneous presence of 1 μM apomorphine during tetanization abolishes this effect of domperidone indicating the specific dopaminolytic nature of its action. Also the presence of the dopamine antagonists sulpiride and flupenthixol, respectively, in a concentration of 1 μM during tetanization likewise prevents the occurrence of the LTP maintenance. The determination of [14C]dopamine in 2 min fractions from the superfused slices after preloading during a preincubation period revealed that a low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals with 0.33 Hz does not influence the spontaneous efflux of dopamine, whereas the tetanization with an impulse train of 100 Hz produces a significantly enhanced release. The observations suggest that dopaminergwhereas the tetanization with an impulse train of 100 Hz produces a significantly enhanced release. The observations suggest that dopaminergic influences during and immediately after tetanization at least additionally contribute to the induction of postsynaptic mechanisms subserving a late, long-lasting maintenance of potentiation.

The formation of habits, which requires simple updating of cached values, has been studied in great detail, and the reward prediction error theory of dopamine function has enjoyed prominent success in accounting for its neural bases. In contrast, the neural circuit mechanisms of goal-directed decision making, requiring extended iterative computations to estimate values online, are still unknown. Here we present a spiking neural network that provably solves the difficult online value estimation problem underlying goal-directed decision making in a near-optimal way and reproduces behavioral as well as neurophysiological experimental data on tasks ranging from simple binary choice to sequential decision making. Our model uses local plasticity rules to learn the synaptic weights of a simple neural network to achieve optimal performance and solves one-step decision-making tasks, commonly considered in neuroeconomics, as well as more challenging sequential decision-making tasks within 1 s. These decision times, and their parametric dependence on task parameters, as well as the final choice probabilities match behavioral data, whereas the evolution of neural activities in the network closely mimics neural responses recorded in frontal cortices during the execution of such tasks. Our theory provides a principled framework to understand the neural underpinning of goal-directed decision making and makes novel predictions for sequential decision-making tasks with multiple rewards.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Goal-directed actions requiring prospective planning pervade decision making, but their circuit-level mechanisms remain elusive. We show how a model circuit of biologically realistic spiking neurons can solve this computationally challenging problem in a novel way. The synaptic weights of our network can be learned using local plasticity rules such that its dynamics devise a near-optimal plan of action. By systematically comparing our model results to experimental data, we show that it reproduces behavioral decision times and choice probabilities as well as neural responses in a rich set of tasks. Our results thus offer the first biologically realistic account for complex goal-directed decision making at a computational, algorithmic, and implementational level.",,,,,,,,,"Friedrich, Johannes and Lengyel, M{\'a}t{\'e}",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-08 17:29:04 +0100,2021-01-08 17:29:23 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2854-15.2016,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/5/1529.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,1529--1546,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Goal-Directed Decision Making with Spiking Neurons,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/5/1529,36,2016,
article,Friston2002N,"In Friston et al. ((2002) Neuroimage 16: 465--483) we introduced empirical Bayes as a potentially useful way to estimate and make inferences about effects in hierarchical models. In this paper we present a series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning). To illustrate the use of the expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important problems in fMRI: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii) The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii) The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally, (iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects. The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability in multisubject hierarchical fMRI studies. In the second half of this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel) level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the (between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs) have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in relation to underlying anatomy. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional SPMs they are not confounded by the multiple comparison problem that, in a classical context, dictates high thresholds and low sensitivity. We conclude with some general comments on Bayesian approaches to image analysis and on some unresolved issues.",,,,,,,,,"Friston, K.J. and Glaser, D.E. and Henson, R.N.A. and Kiebel, S. and Phillips, C. and Ashburner, J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-16 11:36:57 +0200,2020-07-16 11:38:09 +0200,,,10.1006/nimg.2002.1091,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,2,,,484--512,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Classical and Bayesian Inference in Neuroimaging: Applications,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2002.1091,16,2002,

article,Fuentemilla2010CB,"Working memory allows information from transient events to persist as active neural representations [1] that can be used for goal-directed behaviors such as decision making and learning [2, 3]. Computational modeling based on neuronal firing patterns in animals suggests that one putative mechanism enabling working memory is periodic reactivation (henceforth termed ``replay'') of the maintained information coordinated by neural oscillations at theta (4--8 Hz) and gamma (30--80 Hz) frequency [4, 5, 6]. To investigate this possibility, we trained multivariate pattern classifier decoding algorithms on oscillatory brain responses to images depicting natural scenes, recorded with high temporal resolution via magnetoencephalography. These classifiers were applied to brain activity recorded during the subsequent five second maintenance of the scenes. This decoding revealed replay during the entire maintenance interval. Replay was specific to whether an indoor or an outdoor scene was maintained and whether maintenance centered on configural associations of scene elements or just single scene elements. Replay was coordinated by the phase of theta and the amount of theta coordination was correlated with working memory performance. By confirming the predictions of a mechanistic model and linking these to behavioral performance in humans, these findings identify theta-coupled replay as a mechanism of working memory maintenance.",,,,,,,,,"Fuentemilla, Llu{\'\i}s and Penny, Will D. and Cashdollar, Nathan and Bunzeck, Nico and D{\""u}zel, Emrah",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 14:45:34 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2010.01.057,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,7,,,606--612,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,replay; human,,Theta-Coupled Periodic Replay in Working Memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.01.057,20,2010,

article,Gaesser2013H,"Imagining future events and remembering past events rely on a common core network, but several regions within this network---including the hippocampus---show increased activity for imagining future events compared to remembering past events. It remains unclear whether this hippocampal activity reflects processes related to the demands of constructing details retrieved across disparate episodic memories into coherent imaginary events, encoding these events into memory, novelty detection, or some combination of these processes. We manipulated the degree of constructive processing by comparing activity associated with the initial construction of an imagined scenario with the re‐construction of an imagined scenario (imagine vs. re‐imagine). After accounting for effects of novelty and subsequent memory, we found that a region in the hippocampus was preferentially activated for newly constructed imagined events compared with re‐imagined events. Our results suggest that the hippocampus may support several distinct but related processes that are critical for imagining future events, and they also indicate that a particular region within posterior hippocampus may uniquely contribute to the construction of imagined future events.",,,,,,,,,"Gaesser, Brendan and Spreng, R.

article,Gallistel2004PNAS,"The negatively accelerated, gradually increasing learning curve is an artifact of group averaging in several commonly used basic learning paradigms (pigeon autoshaping, delay- and trace-eye-blink conditioning in the rabbit and rat, autoshaped hopper entry in the rat, plus maze performance in the rat, and water maze performance in the mouse). The learning curves for individual subjects show an abrupt, often step-like increase from the untrained level of responding to the level seen in the well trained subject. The rise is at least as abrupt as that commonly seen in psychometric functions in stimulus detection experiments. It may indicate that the appearance of conditioned behavior is mediated by an evidence-based decision process, as in stimulus detection experiments. If the appearance of conditioned behavior is taken instead to reflect the increase in an underlying associative strength, then a negligible portion of the function relating associative strength to amount of experience is behaviorally visible. Consequently, rate of learning cannot be estimated from the group-average curve; the best measure is latency to the onset of responding, determined for each subject individually.",,,,,,,,,"Gallistel, Charles R. and Fairhurst, Stephen and Balsam, Peter",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 09:20:05 +0100,2020-12-14 09:20:24 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.0404965101,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/36/13124.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,,,13124--13131,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,The learning curve: Implications of a quantitative analysis,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/36/13124,101,2004,

article,Gardumi2016N,"Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) in fMRI has been used to extract information from distributed cortical activation patterns, which may go undetected in conventional univariate analysis. However, little is known about the physical and physiological underpinnings of MVPA in fMRI as well as about the effect of spatial smoothing on its performance. Several studies have addressed these issues, but their investigation was limited to the visual cortex at 3T with conflicting results. Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) fMRI to investigate the effect of spatial resolution and smoothing on decoding of speech content (vowels) and speaker identity from auditory cortical responses. To that end, we acquired high-resolution (1.1mm isotropic) fMRI data and additionally reconstructed them at 2.2 and 3.3mm in-plane spatial resolutions from the original k-space data. Furthermore, the data at each resolution were spatially smoothed with different 3D Gaussian kernel sizes (i.e. no smoothing or 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, or 8.8mm kernels). For all spatial resolutions and smoothing kernels, we demonstrate the feasibility of decoding speech content (vowel) and speaker identity at 7T using support vector machine (SVM) MVPA. In addition, we found that high spatial frequencies are informative for vowel decoding and that the relative contribution of high and low spatial frequencies is different across the two decoding tasks. Moderate smoothing (up to 2.2mm) improved the accuracies for both decoding of vowels and speakers, possibly due to reduction of noise (e.g. residual motion artifacts or instrument noise) while still preserving information at high spatial frequency. In summary, our results show that - even with the same stimuli and within the same brain areas - the optimal spatial resolution for MVPA in fMRI depends on the specific decoding task of interest.",,,,,,,,,"Gardumi, Anna and Ivanov, Dimo and Hausfeld, Lars and Valente, Giancarlo and Formisano, Elia and Uluda{\u g}, K{\^a}mil",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 12:44:53 +0200,2020-07-20 12:45:47 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.02.033,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,7T; Auditory cortex; Multivariate pattern analysis; Spatial resolution; Spatial smoothing; fMRI,,,,,,,,May,,,,,,32--42,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,The effect of spatial resolution on decoding accuracy in {fMRI} multivariate pattern analysis,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.02.033,132,2016,

Goal-directed behaviour outside of spatial navigation similarly requires a representation of abstract forms of relational knowledge. This information relies on the same neural system, but it is not known whether the organisational principles governing continuous maps may extend to the implicit encoding of discrete, non-spatial graphs. Here, we show that the human hippocampal--entorhinal system can represent relationships between objects using a metric that depends on associative strength. We reconstruct a map-like knowledge structure directly from a hippocampal--entorhinal functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation signal in a situation where relationships are non-spatial rather than spatial, discrete rather than continuous, and unavailable to conscious awareness. Notably, the measure that best predicted a behavioural signature of implicit knowledge and blood oxygen level-dependent adaptation was a weighted sum of future states, akin to the successor representation that has been proposed to account for place and grid-cell firing patterns.",,,,,,,,,"Garvert, Mona M and Dolan, Raymond J and Behrens, Timothy EJ",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 14:44:24 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.7554/elife.17086,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,koenigsberg; cognitive map,,A map of abstract relational knowledge in the human hippocampal--entorhinal cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17086,6,2017,
article,Garvert2015N,"Learning induces plasticity in neuronal networks. As neuronal populations contribute to multiple representations, we reasoned plasticity in one representation might influence others. We used human fMRI repetition suppression to show that plasticity induced by learning another individual's values impacts upon a value representation for oneself in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a plasticity also evident behaviorally in a preference shift. We show this plasticity is driven by a striatal ``prediction error,'' signaling the discrepancy between the other's choice and a subject's own preferences. Thus, our data highlight that mPFC encodes agent-independent representations of subjective value, such that prediction errors simultaneously update multiple agents' value representations. As the resulting change in representational similarity predicts interindividual differences in the malleability of subjective preferences, our findings shed mechanistic light on complex human processes such as the powerful influence of social interaction on beliefs and preferences.",,,,,,,,,"Garvert, Mona M. and Moutoussis, Michael and Kurth-Nelson, Zeb and Behrens, Timothy E.J. and Dolan, Raymond J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-15 19:59:05 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.033,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,2,,,418--428,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Learning-Induced Plasticity in Medial Prefrontal Cortex Predicts Preference Malleability,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.033,85,2015,

Across different environments, however, hippocampal maps are randomized, making it unclear how goal locations could be encoded consistently. To address this question, we developed a virtual reality task with shifting reward contingencies to distinguish place versus reward encoding. In mice performing the task, large-scale recordings in CA1 and subiculum revealed a small, specialized cell population that was only active near reward yet whose activity could not be explained by sensory cues or stereotyped reward anticipation behavior. Across different virtual environments, most cells remapped randomly, but reward encoding consistently arose from a single pool of cells, suggesting that they formed a dedicated channel for reward.

article,Geerts2020PNAS,"A central question in neuroscience concerns how humans and animals trade off multiple decision-making strategies. Another question pertains to the use of egocentric and allocentric strategies during navigation. We introduce reinforcement-learning models based on learning to predict future reward directly from states and actions or via learning to predict future {\textquotedblleft}successor{\textquotedblright} states, choosing actions from either system based on the reliability of its predictions. We show that this model explains behavior on both spatial and nonspatial decision tasks, and we map the two model components onto the function of the dorsal hippocampus and the dorsolateral striatum, thereby unifying findings from the spatial-navigation and decision-making fields.Humans and other animals use multiple strategies for making decisions. Reinforcement-learning theory distinguishes between stimulus{\textendash}response (model-free; MF) learning and deliberative (model-based; MB) planning. The spatial-navigation literature presents a parallel dichotomy between navigation strategies. In {\textquotedblleft}response learning,{\textquotedblright} associated with the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), decisions are anchored to an egocentric reference frame. In {\textquotedblleft}place learning,{\textquotedblright} associated with the hippocampus, decisions are anchored to an allocentric reference frame. Emerging evidence suggests that the contribution of hippocampus to place learning may also underlie its contribution to MB learning by representing relational structure in a cognitive map. Here, we introduce a computational model in which hippocampus subserves place and MB learning by learning a {\textquotedblleft}successor representation{\textquotedblright} of relational structure between states; DLS implements model-free response learning by learning associations between actions and egocentric representations of landmarks; and action values from either system are weighted by the reliability of its predictions. We show that this model reproduces a range of seemingly disparate behavioral findings in spatial and nonspatial decision tasks and explains the effects of lesions to DLS and hippocampus on these tasks. Furthermore, modeling place cells as driven by boundaries explains the observation that, unlike navigation guided by landmarks, navigation guided by boundaries is robust to {\textquotedblleft}blocking{\textquotedblright} by prior state{\textendash}reward associations due to learned associations between place cells. Our model, originally shaped by detailed constraints in the spatial literature, successfully characterizes the hippocampal{\textendash}striatal system as a general system for decision making via adaptive combination of stimulus{\textendash}response learning and the use of a cognitive map.",,,,,,,,,"Geerts, Jesse P. and Chersi, Fabian and Stachenfeld, Kimberly L. and Burgess, Neil",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-25 12:20:58 +0100,2021-01-25 12:21:18 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.2007981117,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/31427.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49,,,31427--31437,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,A general model of hippocampal and dorsal striatal learning and decision making,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/31427,117,2020,
article,Gelbard-Sagiv2008S,"The emergence of memory, a trace of things past, into human consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries of the human mind. Whereas the neuronal basis of recognition memory can be probed experimentally in human and nonhuman primates, the study of free recall requires that the mind declare the occurrence of a recalled memory (an event intrinsic to the organism and invisible to an observer). Here, we report the activity of single neurons in the human hippocampus and surrounding areas when subjects first view cinematic episodes consisting of audiovisual sequences and again later when they freely recall these episodes. A subset of these neurons exhibited selective firing, which often persisted throughout and following specific episodes for as long as 12 seconds.

These ``off-line'' processes consolidate the memory, leading to its enhancement and to changes in memory circuits. Potentially, these memory changes are driven by off-line replay of the pattern of neuronal activity present when the memory was being formed. A new study by Dhaksin Ramanathan and colleagues, published in PLOS Biology, demonstrates that replay occurs predominately after the acquisition of a new motor skill and that it is related to changes in memory performance and to the subsequent changes in memory circuits.

The present study explored the hypothesis that age-related changes in this process might contribute to memory impairments observed during normal aging. Neuronal activity was recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells, and in both young and old rats, there was a strong similarity between the resting epoch activity patterns and those from the preceding behavior epoch. This similarity was strongest during sharp-wave events. There were no detectable differences in the reactivation process or the decay rate between the young and old age groups.

article,Gershman2014JEPG,"Recent computational theories of decision making in humans and animals have portrayed 2 systems locked in a battle for control of behavior. One system--variously termed model-free or habitual--favors actions that have previously led to reward, whereas a second--called the model-based or goal-directed system--favors actions that causally lead to reward according to the agent's internal model of the environment. Some evidence suggests that control can be shifted between these systems using neural or behavioral manipulations, but other evidence suggests that the systems are more intertwined than a competitive account would imply. In 4 behavioral experiments, using a retrospective revaluation design and a cognitive load manipulation, we show that human decisions are more consistent with a cooperative architecture in which the model-free system controls behavior, whereas the model-based system trains the model-free system by replaying and simulating experience.",,,,,,,,,"Gershman, Samuel J and Markman, Arthur B and Otto, A Ross",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-11 11:50:14 +0100,2020-12-11 11:51:45 +0100,,,10.1037/a0030844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,1,,,182--194,,,,,,,,,,,,Retrospective revaluation in sequential decision making: a tale of two systems.,,,,,,143,2014,
article,Gershman2015COBS,"Effective reinforcement learning hinges on having an appropriate state representation. But where does this representation come from? We argue that the brain discovers state representations by trying to infer the latent causal structure of the task at hand, and assigning each latent cause to a separate state. In this paper, we review several implications of this latent cause framework, with a focus on Pavlovian conditioning. The framework suggests that conditioning is not the acquisition of associations between cues and outcomes, but rather the acquisition of associations between latent causes and observable stimuli. A latent cause interpretation of conditioning enables us to begin answering questions that have frustrated classical theories: Why do extinguished responses sometimes return? Why do stimuli presented in compound sometimes summate and sometimes do not? Beyond conditioning, the principles of latent causal inference may provide a general theory of structure learning across cognitive domains.",,,,,,,,,"Gershman, Samuel J and Norman, Kenneth A and Niv, Yael",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-21 13:36:25 +0100,2021-01-21 13:36:43 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.07.007,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-1546,,,Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neuroeconomics,,,,43 - 50,,,,,,,,,,,,Discovering latent causes in reinforcement learning,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615001059,5,2015,

We now understand a great deal about the brain{\textquoteright}s reinforcement learning algorithms, but we know considerably less about the representations of states and actions over which these algorithms operate. A useful starting point is asking what kinds of representations we would want the brain to have, given the constraints on its computational architecture. Following this logic leads to the idea of the successor representation, which encodes states of the environment in terms of their predictive relationships with other states. Recent behavioral and neural studies have provided evidence for the successor representation, and computational studies have explored ways to extend the original idea.

They focus on renewal and latent inhibition, 2 conditioning paradigms in which contextual manipulations have been studied extensively, and show that online Bayesian inference within a model that assumes an unbounded number of latent causes can characterize a diverse set of behavioral results from such manipulations, some of which pose problems for the model of Redish et al.

article,Gershman2017ARP,"We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning (RL), which has experienced significant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decision-making tasks. However, one challenge in the study of RL is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning system.",,,,,,,,,"Gershman, Samuel J. and Daw, Nathaniel D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-08 13:50:51 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033625,,,,,,,,,,,,1545-2085,,,Annual Review of Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,1,,,101--128,,,,Annual Reviews,,,,,,memory; review,,Reinforcement Learning and Episodic Memory in Humans and Animals: An Integrative Framework,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033625,68,2017,
article,Gershman2012NC,"The successor representation was introduced into reinforcement learning by Dayan (1993) as a means of facilitating generalization between states with similar successors. Although reinforcement learning in general has been used extensively as a model of psychological and neural processes, the psychological validity of the successor representation has yet to be explored. An interesting possibility is that the successor representation can be used not only for reinforcement learning but for episodic learning as well. Our main contribution is to show that a variant of the temporal context model (TCM; Howard & Kahana, 2002), an influential model of episodic memory, can be understood as directly estimating the successor representation using the temporal difference learning algorithm (Sutton & Barto, 1998).

article,Gilboa2014CB,"Behavior in the real world is rarely motivated by primary conditioned stimuli that have been directly associated with potent unconditioned reinforcers. Instead, motivation and choice behavior are driven by complex chains of higher-order associations that are only indirectly linked to intrinsic reward and often exert their influence outside awareness. Second-order conditioning (SOC) [1] is a basic associative-learning mechanism whereby stimuli acquire motivational salience by proxy, in the absence of primary incentives [2, 3]. Memory-systems theories consider first-order conditioning (FOC) and SOC to be prime examples of hippocampal-independent nondeclarative memory [4, 5]. Accordingly, neurobiological models of SOC focus almost exclusively on nondeclarative neural systems that support motivational salience and reward value. Transfer of value from a conditioned stimulus to a neutral stimulus is thought to require the basolateral amygdala [6, 7] and the ventral striatum [2, 3], but not the hippocampus. We developed a new paradigm to measure appetitive SOC of tones in rats. Hippocampal lesions severely impaired both acquisition and expression of SOC despite normal FOC. Unlike controls, rats with hippocampal lesions could not discriminate between positive and negative secondary conditioned tones, although they exhibited general familiarity with previously presented tones compared with new tones. Importantly, normal rats' behavior, in contrast to that of hippocampal groups, also revealed different confidence levels as indexed by effort, a central characteristic of hippocampal relational memory. The results indicate, contrary to current systems models, that representations of intrinsic relationships between reward value, stimulus identity, and motivation require hippocampal mediation when these relationships are of a higher order.",,,,,,,,,"Gilboa, Asaf and Sekeres, Melanie and Moscovitch, Morris and Winocur, Gordon",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 13:57:27 +0100,2020-11-30 13:58:03 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2014.07.078,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,,,2202 - 2207,,,,,,,,,,,,Higher-Order Conditioning Is Impaired by Hippocampal Lesions,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214009750,24,2014,
article,Giovannini2001N,"The involvement of the forebrain cholinergic system in arousal, learning and memory has been well established. Other neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate may be involved in the mechanisms of memory by modulating the forebrain cholinergic pathways. We studied the activity of cortical and hippocampal cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic systems during novelty and habituation in the rat using microdialysis. After establishing basal release of the neurotransmitters, the animals were transferred to a novel environment and allowed to explore it twice consecutively for 30 min (60 min apart; exploration I and II). The motor activity was monitored. Samples were collected throughout the experiment and the release of acetylcholine (ACh), GABA and glutamate was measured. During the two consecutive explorations of the arena, cortical and hippocampal, ACh release showed a significant tetrodotoxin-dependent increase which was higher during exploration I than II. The effect was more pronounced and longer-lasting in the hippocampus than in the cortex. Cortical GABA release increased significantly only during exploration II, while hippocampal GABA release did not increase during either exploration. Motor activity was higher during the first 10 min of exploration I and II and then gradually decreased during the further 20 min. Both cortical and hippocampal ACh release were positively correlated with motor activity during exploration II, but not during I. During exploration II, cortical GABA release was inversely correlated, while hippocampal GABA release was positively correlated to motor activity. No change in cortical and hippocampal glutamate release was observed. In summary, ACh released by the animal placed in a novel environment seems to have two components, one related to motor activity and one related to attention, anxiety and fear. This second component disappears in the familiar environment, where ACh release is directly related to motor activity. The negative relationship between cortical GABA levels and motor activity may indicate that cortical GABAergic activity is involved in habituation.",,,,,,,,,"Giovannini, M.G and Rakovska, A and Benton, R.S and Pazzagli, M and Bianchi, L and Pepeu, G",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-13 14:20:15 +0100,2021-01-13 14:20:30 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(01)00266-4,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4522,,,Neuroscience,,,"exploration, microdialysis, motor activity",,,,,,,,,,,1,,,43 - 53,,,,,,,,,,,,"Effects of novelty and habituation on acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate release from the frontal cortex and hippocampus of freely moving rats",,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452201002664,106,2001,

article,Girardeau2011CON,"During slow wave sleep and quiet wakefulness, the hippocampus generates high frequency field oscillations (ripples) during which pyramidal neurons replay previous waking activity in a temporally compressed manner. As a result, reactivated firing patterns occur within shorter time windows propitious for synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal network and in downstream neocortical structures. This is consistent with the long-held view that ripples participate in strengthening and reorganizing memory traces, possibly by mediating information transfer to neocortical areas. Recent studies have confirmed that ripples and associated neuronal reactivations play a causal role in memory consolidation during sleep and rest. However, further research will be necessary to better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of memory consolidation, in particular the selection of reactivated assemblies, and the functional specificity of awake ripples.",,,,,,,,,"Girardeau, Gabrielle and Zugaro, Micha{\""e}l",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-12 18:23:28 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.conb.2011.02.005,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-4388,,,Current Opinion in Neurobiology,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,3,,,452--459,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,replay; review; ripples,,Hippocampal ripples and memory consolidation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2011.02.005,21,2011,
article,Giusti2015PNAS,"Detecting meaningful structure in neural activity and connectivity data is challenging in the presence of hidden nonlinearities, where traditional eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading. We introduce a novel approach to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only on the relative ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was exploring a 2D environment, and confirmed that our method is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern of neural correlations. Remarkably, we found similar results during nonspatial behaviors such as wheel running and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This suggests that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying hippocampal circuits and is not merely a consequence of position coding. We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.",,,,,,,,,"Giusti, Chad and Pastalkova, Eva and Curto, Carina and Itskov, Vladimir",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAcLi4vcGFwZXJzL2dpdXN0aTIwMTVwbmFzLnBkZk8RAXQAAAAAAXQAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////xJnaXVzdGkyMDE1cG5hcy5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAQS86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6Z2l1c3RpMjAxNXBuYXMucGRmAAAOACYAEgBnAGkAdQBzAHQAaQAyADAAMQA1AHAAbgBhAHMALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA/VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvZ2l1c3RpMjAxNXBuYXMucGRmAAATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABDAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbs=,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 12:13:44 +0200,2020-05-11 12:14:03 +0200,,,10.1073/pnas.1506407112,,,,,,,,,,,,1091-6490,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,44,,,13455--13460,,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Clique topology reveals intrinsic geometric structure in neural correlations,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1506407112,112,2015,
article,Gluck1993H,"The authors propose a computational theory of the hippocampal region's function in mediating stimulus representations. The theory assumes that the hippocampal region develops new stimulus representations that enhance the discriminability of differentially predictive cues while compressing the representation of redundant cues. Other brain regions, including cerebral and cerebellar cortices, are presumed to use these hippocampal representations to recode their own stimulus representations. In the absence of an intact hippocmpal region, the theory implies that other brain regions will attempt to learn associations using previously established fixed representations. Instantiated as a connectionist network model, the theory provides a simple and unified interpretation of the functional role of the hippocampal region in a wide range of conditioning paradigms, including stimulus discrimination, reversal learning, stimulus generalization, latent inhibition, sensory preconditioning, and contextual sensitivity. The theory makes novel predictions regarding the effects of hippocampal lesions on easy-hard transfer and compound preexposure. Several prior qualitative characterizations of hippocampal function--including stimulus selection, chunking, cue configuration, and cotextual coding--are identified as task-specific special cases derivable from this more general theory. The theory suggests that a profitable direction for future empirical and theoretical research will be the study of learning tasks in which both intact and lesioned animals exhibit similar initial learning behaviors but differ on subsequent transfer and generalization tasks.",,,,,,,,,"Gluck, Mark A. and Myers, Catherine E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 12:15:40 +0100,2021-01-18 12:16:07 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.450030410,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.450030410,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"neurocomputation, computational models, representation, declarative memory, conditioning, connectionist models",,,,,,,,,,,4,,,491-516,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampal mediation of stimulus representation: A computational theory,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.450030410,3,1993,
article,Golden2020B,"Artificial neural networks overwrite previously learned tasks when trained sequentially, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, the brain learns continuously, and typically learns best when new learning is interleaved with periods of sleep for memory consolidation. In this study, we used spiking network to study mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and the role of sleep in preventing it. The network could be trained to learn a complex foraging task but exhibited catastrophic forgetting when trained sequentially on multiple tasks. New task training moved the synaptic weight configuration away from the manifold representing old tasks leading to forgetting.

article,Gomperts2015E,"Spatial learning requires the hippocampus, and the replay of spatial sequences during hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) events of quiet wakefulness and sleep is believed to play a crucial role. To test whether the coordination of VTA reward prediction error signals with these replayed spatial sequences could contribute to this process, we recorded from neuronal ensembles of the hippocampus and VTA as rats performed appetitive spatial tasks and subsequently slept. We found that many reward responsive (RR) VTA neurons coordinated with quiet wakefulness-associated hippocampal SPW-R events that replayed recent experience. In contrast, coordination between RR neurons and SPW-R events in subsequent slow wave sleep was diminished. Together, these results indicate distinct contributions of VTA reinforcement activity associated with hippocampal spatial replay to the processing of wake and SWS-associated spatial memory.",,,,,,,,,"Gomperts, Stephen N and Kloosterman, Fabian and Wilson, Matthew A",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL2dvbXBlcnRzMjAxNWUucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EWdvbXBlcnRzMjAxNWUucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpnb21wZXJ0czIwMTVlLnBkZgAOACQAEQBnAG8AbQBwAGUAcgB0AHMAMgAwADEANQBlAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2dvbXBlcnRzMjAxNWUucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 10:11:25 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.7554/elife.05360,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,replay,,{VTA} neurons coordinate with the hippocampal reactivation of spatial experience,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05360,4,2015,
article,Gonzalez2020E,"Continual learning remains an unsolved problem in artificial neural networks. The brain has evolved mechanisms to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge during new training. Building upon data suggesting the importance of sleep in learning and memory, we tested a hypothesis that sleep protects old memories from being forgotten after new learning. In the thalamocortical model, training a new memory interfered with previously learned old memories leading to degradation and forgetting of the old memory traces. Simulating sleep after new learning reversed the damage and enhanced old and new memories. We found that when a new memory competed for previously allocated neuronal/synaptic resources, sleep replay changed the synaptic footprint of the old memory to allow overlapping neuronal populations to store multiple memories. Our study predicts that memory storage is dynamic, and sleep enables continual learning by combining consolidation of new memory traces with reconsolidation of old memory traces to minimize interference.",,,,,,,,journal,"Gonz{\'a}lez, Oscar C and Sokolov, Yury and Krishnan, Giri P and Delanois, Jean Erik and Bazhenov, Maxim",,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,,,,,,,eLife 2020;9:e51005,,,,2021-01-19 20:16:13 +0100,2021-01-19 20:16:42 +0100,,,10.7554/eLife.51005,,,"van Rossum, Mark CW and Colgin, Laura L and Battaglia, Francesco P",,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,"sleep, memory consolidation, continual learning, neural network, catastrophic forgetting",,,,,,,,aug,,,,,,e51005,,,2020-08-04,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,Can sleep protect memories from catastrophic forgetting?,,,,,https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.51005,9,2020,

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols.

article,Gorgolewski2011FN,"Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage.

article,Graves2016N,"Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols.

However, it is unclear whether conscious learning is essential for the exhibition of flexibility in learning. Successful performance on the transitive inference task requires representational flexibility. Participants learned four overlapping premise pairs (A > B, B > C, C > D, D > E) that could be encoded separately or as a sequential hierarchy (A > B > C > D > E). Some participants (informed) were told prior to training that the task required an inference made from premise pairs. Other participants (uninformed) were told simply that they were to learn a series of pairs by trial and error. Testing consisted of unreinforced trials that included the nonadjacent pair, B versus D, to assess capacity for transitive inference. Not surprisingly, those in the informed condition outperformed those in the uninformed condition. After completion of training and testing, uninformed participants were given a postexperimental questionnaire to assess awareness of the task structure. In contrast with expectations, successful performance on the transitive inference task for uninformed participants does not depend on or correlate with postexperimental awareness.

article,Greve2009N,"The fine spatial scales of the structures in the human brain represent an enormous challenge to the successful integration of information from different images for both within- and between-subject analysis. While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate.",,,,,,,,,"Greve, Douglas N. and Fischl, Bruce",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-13 16:14:10 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.060,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,1,,,63--72,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,fmriprep,,Accurate and robust brain image alignment using boundary-based registration,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.060,48,2009,
article,Gridchyn2020N,"Memory consolidation is thought to depend on the reactivation of waking hippocampal firing patterns during sleep. Following goal learning, the reactivation of place cell firing can represent goals and predicts subsequent memory recall. However, it is unclear whether reactivation promotes the recall of the reactivated memories only or triggers wider reorganization. We trained animals to locate goals at fixed locations in two different environments. Following learning, by performing online assembly content decoding, the reactivation of only one environment was disrupted, leading to recall deficit in that environment. The place map of the disrupted environment was destabilized but re-emerged once the goal was relearned.

However, it is unclear whether such firing represents the animal's intended destination or the execution of a specific trajectory. To distinguish between these possibilities, Lister Hooded rats (n = 8) were trained to navigate from a start box to three goal locations via four partially overlapping routes. Two of these led to the same goal location. Of the cells that fired on these two routes, 95.8\% showed route-dependent firing (firing on only one route), whereas only two cells (4.2\%) showed goal-dependent firing (firing similarly on both routes). In addition, route-dependent place cells over-represented the less discriminable routes, and place cells in general over-represented the start location.

article,Grieves2020B,"We investigated how entorhinal grid cells represent volumetric (three-dimensional) space. On a flat surface, grid cell firing fields are circular and arranged in a close-packed hexagonal array. In three dimensions, theoretical and computational work suggests that the most efficient configuration would be a regular close packing of spherical fields. We report that in rats exploring a cubic lattice, grid cells were spatially stable and maintained normal directional modulation, theta modulation and spike dynamics. However, while the majority of grid fields were spherical, they were irregularly arranged, even when only fields abutting the lower surface (equivalent to the floor) were considered. Thus, grid organization is shaped by the environment{\textquoteright}s movement affordances, and may not need to be regular to support spatial computations.One Sentence Summary In rats exploring a volumetric space, grid cells are spatially modulated but their firing fields are irregularly arranged.Competing Interest StatementThe Authors declare the following competing interests: K.J. is a non-shareholding director of Axona Ltd.",,,,,,,,,"Grieves, Roddy M. and Jedidi-Ayoub, Selim and Mishchanchuk, Karyna and Liu, Anyi and Renaudineau, Sophie and Duvelle, {\'E}l{\'e}onore and Jeffery, Kate J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 11:40:52 +0100,2020-12-14 11:41:08 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.06.413542,,,,,2020.12.06.413542,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/07/2020.12.06.413542.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Grid cell firing fields in a volumetric space,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/07/2020.12.06.413542,,2020,

article,Grieves2017BP,"Animals can navigate vast distances and often display behaviours or activities that indicate a detailed, internal spatial representation of their surrounding environment or a `cognitive map'. Over a century of behavioural research on spatial navigation in humans and animals has greatly increased our understanding of how this highly complex feat is achieved. In turn this has inspired half a century of electrophysiological spatial navigation and memory research which has further advanced our understanding of the brain. In particular, three functional cell types have been suggested to underlie cognitive mapping processes; place cells, head direction cells and grid cells. However, there are numerous other spatially modulated neurons in the brain. For a more complete understanding of the electrophysiological systems and behavioural processes underlying spatial navigation we must also examine these lesser understood neurons. In this review we will briefly summarise the literature surrounding place cells, head direction cells, grid cells and the evidence that these cells collectively form the neural basis of a cognitive map.

We sought to replicate this finding in rats, on a conceptually analogous task. In a first experiment, rats (n = 8) were given 110 training trials on a task in which they entered a series of four square environments via connecting alleyways. Following training, we conducted a probe session in which the original training route was blocked and three novel routes were introduced, one of which led directly to the food reward. Surprisingly, rats failed to choose this shortcut route over the alternative routes. In a second experiment, following additional training with a series of platforms that were visible from one another, rats again failed to take a shortcut when given the opportunity to do so. In a third experiment with naive rats (n = 11), a shortcut was chosen, but only by rats that were given unrewarded preexposure to the shortcut route.

article,Grinband2008N,"In neuroimaging research on attention, cognitive control, decision-making, and other areas where response time (RT) is a critical variable, the temporal variability associated with the decision is often assumed to be inconsequential to the hemodynamic response (HDR) in rapid event-related designs. On this basis, the majority of published studies model brain activity lasting less than 4 s with brief impulses representing the onset of neural or cognitive events, which are then convolved with the hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF). However, electrophysiological studies have shown that decision-related neuronal activity is not instantaneous, but in fact, often lasts until the motor response. It is therefore possible that small differences in neural processing durations, similar to human RTs, will produce noticeable changes in the HDR, and therefore in the results of regression analyses. In this study we compare the effectiveness of traditional models that assume no temporal variance with a model that explicitly accounts for the duration of very brief epochs of neural activity. Using both simulations and fMRI data, we show that brief differences in duration are detectable, making it possible to dissociate the effects of stimulus intensity from stimulus duration, and that optimizing the model for the type of activity being detected improves the statistical power, consistency, and interpretability of results.",,,,,,,,,"Grinband, Jack and Wager, Tor D. and Lindquist, Martin and Ferrera, Vincent P. and Hirsch, Joy",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-07 13:20:33 +0200,2020-08-07 13:20:59 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.07.065,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,3,,,509--520,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Detection of time-varying signals in event-related {fMRI} designs,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.07.065,43,2008,

Under these conditions, theories propose that uncertainty can be used to modulate learning rates (""meta-learning""). We show that mice behaving in a dynamic foraging task exhibit choice behavior that varied as a function of two forms of uncertainty estimated from a meta-learning model. The activity of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons tracked both types of uncertainty in the foraging task, as well as in a dynamic Pavlovian task.

article,Gruber2019TCS,"A fledgling line of curiosity research shows how states of curiosity enhance learning and retention. To account for the current evidence, we propose the Prediction, Appraisal, Curiosity, and Exploration (PACE) framework, which integrates the emergent research on curiosity and draws on a range of ideas from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience. PACE proposes that curiosity is triggered by significant prediction errors that are appraised. This cycle enhances memory encoding through increased attention, exploration, and information seeking and enhances the consolidation of information acquired while in a curious state through dopaminergic neuromodulation of the hippocampus. The PACE framework provides a common reference scheme for future research on curiosity-mediated memory and generates testable predictions to stimulate further research. Curiosity plays a fundamental role for learning and memory, but the neural mechanisms that stimulate curiosity and its effect on memory are poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that curiosity states are related to modulations in activity in the dopaminergic circuit and that these modulations impact memory encoding and consolidation for both targets of curiosity and incidental information encountered during curiosity states. To account for this evidence, we propose the Prediction, Appraisal, Curiosity, and Exploration (PACE) framework, which attempts to explain curiosity and memory in terms of cognitive processes, neural circuits, behavior, and subjective experience.

article,Gruber2016N,"Reward motivation is known to modulate memory encoding, and this effect depends on interactions between the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area complex (SN/VTA) and the hippocampus. It is unknown, however, whether these interactions influence offline neural activity in the human brain that is thought to promote memory consolidation. Here we used fMRI to test the effect of reward motivation on post-learning neural dynamics and subsequent memory for objects that were learned in high- and low-reward motivation contexts. We found that post-learning increases in resting-state functional connectivity between the SN/VTA and hippocampus predicted preferential retention of objects that were learned in high-reward contexts. In addition, multivariate pattern classification revealed that hippocampal representations of high-reward contexts were preferentially reactivated during post-learning rest, and the number of hippocampal reactivations was predictive of preferential retention of items learned in high-reward contexts. These findings indicate that reward motivation alters offline post-learning dynamics between the SN/VTA and hippocampus, providing novel evidence for a potential mechanism by which reward could influence memory consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Gruber, Matthias J. and Ritchey, Maureen and Wang, Shao-Fang and Doss, Manoj K. and Ranganath, Charan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-27 17:25:19 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.017,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,5,,,1110--1120,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,reactivation; replay; human; hippocampus; MRI,,Post-learning Hippocampal Dynamics Promote Preferential Retention of Rewarding Events,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.017,89,2016,

It remains unclear how and when the nervous system solves this 'credit assignment' problem. Using neuroprosthetic learning, in which we could control the causal relationship between neurons and behavior, we found that sleep-dependent processing was required for credit assignment and the establishment of task-related functional connectivity reflecting the casual neuron--behavior relationship. Notably, we observed a strong link between the microstructure of sleep reactivations and credit assignment, with downscaling of non-causal activity. Decoupling of spiking to slow oscillations using optogenetic methods eliminated rescaling.

article,Gupta2010N,"Summary
Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for >10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.",,,,,,,,,"Gupta, Anoopum S. and van der Meer, Matthijs A.A. and Touretzky, David S. and Redish, A.

article,Gustafson2011PCB,"The central problem of learning is generalization: how to apply what was discovered in past experiences to future situations, which will inevitably be the same in some respects and different in others. Effective learning requires generalizing appropriately: to situations which are similar in relevant respects, though of course the trick is determining what is relevant. In this article, we quantify and investigate relevant generalization in the context of a particular learning problem often studied in the laboratory: learning to navigate in a spatial maze. In particular, we consider whether the brain's well-characterized systems for representing an organism's location in space generalize appropriately for this task. Our simulations of learning verify that to generalize effectively, these representations should treat nearby locations similarly (that is, neurons should fire similarly when an animal occupies nearby locations)---but, more subtly, that to enable successful learning, ``nearby'' must be defined in terms of paths around obstacles, rather than in absolute space ``as the crow flies.''

In the hippocampus, such sequences, conventionally called preplay, have been hypothesized to participate in learning and memory. Here, we present a computational model for encoding input sequence patterns into internal network states based on the propagation of preplay sequences in recurrent neuronal networks. The model instantiates two synaptic pathways in cortical neurons, one for proximal dendrite-somatic interactions to generate intrinsic preplay sequences and the other for distal dendritic processing of extrinsic signals. The core dendritic computation is the maximization of matching between patterned activities in the two compartments through nonlinear spike generation. The model performs robust single-trial learning with long-term stability and independence that are modulated by the plasticity of dendrite-targeted inhibition.

Symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in CA3 likely potentiates recurrent synapses for both forward (start to goal) and reverse (goal to start) replays during sequential activation of place cells. However, how reverse replay selectively strengthens forward synaptic pathway is unclear. Here, we show computationally that firing sequences bias synaptic transmissions to the opposite direction of propagation under symmetric STDP in the co-presence of short-term synaptic depression or afterdepolarization. We demonstrate that significant biases are created in biologically realistic simulation settings, and this bias enables reverse replay to enhance goal-directed spatial memory on a W-maze. Further, we show that essentially the same mechanism works in a two-dimensional open field.

article,Haga2020B,"Our cognition relies on the ability of the brain to segment hierarchically structured events on multiple scales. Recent evidence suggests that the brain performs this event segmentation based on the structure of state-transition graphs behind sequential experiences. However, the underlying circuit mechanisms are only poorly understood. In this paper, we propose an extended attractor network model for the graph-based hierarchical computation, called as Laplacian associative memory. This model generates multiscale representations for communities (clusters) of associative links between memory items, and the scale is regulated by heterogenous modulation of inhibitory circuits. We analytically and numerically show that these representations correspond to graph Laplacian eigenvectors, a popular method for graph segmentation and dimensionality reduction. Finally, we demonstrate that our model with asymmetricity exhibits chunking resembling to hippocampal theta sequences. Our model connects graph theory and the attractor dynamics to provide a biologically plausible mechanism for abstraction in the brain.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Haga, Tatsuya and Fukai, Tomoki",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-02 17:59:46 +0100,2021-01-02 18:00:04 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.24.424371,,,,,2020.12.24.424371,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/24/2020.12.24.424371.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Associative memory networks for graph-based abstraction,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/24/2020.12.24.424371,,2020,

article,Hall-McMaster2021B,"Foraging is a common decision problem in natural environments. When new exploitable sites are always available, a simple optimal strategy is to leave a current site when its return falls below a single average reward rate. Here, we examined foraging in a more structured environment, with a limited number of sites that replenished at different rates and had to be revisited. When participants could choose sites, they visited fast-replenishing sites more often, left sites at higher levels of reward, and achieved a higher net reward rate. Decisions to exploit-or-leave a site were best explained with a computational model estimating separate reward rates for each site. This suggests option-specific information can be used to construct a threshold for patch leaving in some foraging settings, rather than a single average reward rate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Hall-McMaster, Sam and Dayan, Peter and Schuck, Nicolas W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-20 11:34:54 +0100,2021-01-20 11:35:11 +0100,,,10.1101/2021.01.19.426950,,,,,2021.01.19.426950,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/01/19/2021.01.19.426950.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Control over patch encounters changes foraging behaviour,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/01/19/2021.01.19.426950,,2021,
article,Hall-McMaster2019JN,"Cognitive flexibility is critical for intelligent behavior. However, its execution is effortful and often suboptimal. Recent work indicates that flexible behavior can be improved by the prospect of reward, which suggests that rewards optimize flexible control processes. Here we investigated how different reward prospects influence neural encoding of task rule information to optimize cognitive flexibility. We applied representational similarity analysis to human electroencephalograms, recorded while female and male participants performed a rule-guided decision-making task. During the task, the prospect of reward varied from trial to trial. Participants made faster, more accurate judgements on high-reward trials. Critically, high reward boosted neural coding of the active task rule, and the extent of this increase was associated with improvements in task performance. Additionally, the effect of high reward on task rule coding was most pronounced on switch trials, where rules were updated relative to the previous trial. These results suggest that reward prospect can promote cognitive performance by strengthening neural coding of task rule information, helping to improve cognitive flexibility during complex behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Hall-McMaster, Sam and Muhle-Karbe, Paul S. and Myers, Nicholas E. and Stokes, Mark G.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-24 11:51:56 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.0631-19.2019,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Sep,,,43,,,8549--8561,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Reward Boosts Neural Coding of Task Rules to Optimize Cognitive Flexibility,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0631-19.2019,39,2019,
article,Hannula2012FHN,"Classic findings from the neuropsychological literature invariably indicated that performances on tests of memory that can be accomplished without conscious awareness were largely spared in amnesia, while those that required conscious retrieval (e.g., via recognition or recall) of information learned in the very same sessions was devastatingly impaired. Based on reports of such dissociations, it was proposed that one of the fundamental distinctions between memory systems is whether or not they support conscious access to remembered content. Only recently have we come to realize that the putative systemic division of labor between conscious and unconscious memory is not so clean. A primary goal of this review is to examine recent evidence that has been advanced against the view that the hippocampus is selectively critical for conscious memory. Along the way, consideration is given to criticisms that have been levied against these findings, potential explanations for differences in the reported results are proposed, and methodological pitfalls in investigations of unconscious memory are discussed. Ultimately, it is concluded that a tipping point has been reached, and that while conscious recollection depends critically on hippocampal integrity, the reach of the hippocampus extends to unconscious aspects of memory performance when relational memory processing and representation are required.

Memory is a ubiquitous part of our daily experience. It is not just the occasional act of remembering an event or an appointment, or being able to recognize an individual as someone seen in the past, the benefits of previous experience facilitate all aspects of thinking, taking action, and perceiving. Therefore, it is not surprising that the organization of memory, the manner in which it is expressed or used, and its representation in the brain have been of substantial interest to philosophers, scientists, and laypeople alike. The idea that memory can take multiple forms was advocated in the early 1800s by the philosopher Maine de Biran, who proposed that representative, mechanical, and sensitive memory were differentially associated with conscious awareness, rigid/inflexible behavior, and emotional lability (Maine de Biran, 1804/1929; see also Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2001). Empirical investigations conducted by modern-day cognitive psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists have extended these views, identifying different classes of memory and characterizing their permanence over time, how they might be expressed in thought and action, and whether or not they depend on conscious apprehension of encoded and/or retrieved content. Indeed, it seems that early philosophical ideas were not far from the mark, as much of the driving force behind contemporary research involves identification and differentiation of memory systems and the neural substrates that support them.

Initial evidence for the memory systems view came from now-classic reports (e.g., Milner, 1962) of spared and impaired memory performances following damage to structures located in the medial aspect of the temporal lobes (MTL; i.e., the hippocampus and adjacent cortical structures in the parahippocampal region). These studies, reviewed briefly below, invariably indicated that performances on tests of memory that proceed relatively automatically (i.e., in the absence of effortful retrieval attempts) and without conscious awareness were largely spared, while those that required amnesic patients to consciously recover (e.g., via recognition or recall) information learned in the very same sessions was devastatingly impaired. Based on reports of such dissociations, it was proposed that one of the fundamental distinctions between memory systems is whether or not they support conscious access to remembered content. This view that memory systems divide on consciousness has now become so ensconced in the field as to be considered essentially a first principle from which new findings can be anchored. Indeed, it has been proposed that one could infer whether or not performance on a particular task was supported by explicit memory processes based on the presence or absence of MTL activity in neuroimaging data (cf. Henson, 2003).

Only recently have we come to realize that the putative systemic division of labor between conscious and unconscious memory is not so clean. Therefore, a primary goal of this review is to examine recent evidence that has been advanced against the view that the hippocampus is selectively critical for conscious memory. As part of this objective, we review evidence for hippocampal involvement in successful memory expression (e.g., in eye movement behavior) when explicit responses are incorrect, hippocampal contributions to learning when participants are unaware of the contingencies that support increasingly proficient responding, and hippocampal recruitment during encoding when materials are presented subliminally (i.e., masked from conscious awareness). Along the way, consideration is given to criticisms that have been levied against these findings (provided that they exist), and potential explanations for differences in the reported results are proposed. In addition, some of the methodological and interpretive pitfalls that can undermine claims for or against hippocampal contributions to memory without awareness are considered; these are described in the context of the associative priming literature, which has a relatively long history in the investigation of questions about memory, awareness, and the MTL. It is important to note that findings are reported from several neuropsychological investigations and that many of these were conducted with patients of mixed etiology (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff's syndrome) who were selected based on their documented memory impairment. When findings can be more confidently attributed to the hippocampus (e.g., because recruitment was limited to patients with relatively circumscribed hippocampal lesions) we say so in the text. Ultimately, it is concluded that we have indeed reached a tipping point, and that the role of the hippocampus in memory has more to do with the processing and representational demands of the task at hand than with conscious awareness. The implications of this conclusion for some theoretical perspectives of hippocampal function are briefly considered, and some suggestions are made as to how best to proceed in future work.",,,,,,,,,"Hannula, Deborah E. and Greene, Anthony J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-21 15:39:49 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.3389/fnhum.2012.00080,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5161,,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,koenigsberg,,The hippocampus reevaluated in unconscious learning and memory: at a tipping point?,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00080,6,2012,
article,Hannula2008JN,"Previous neuropsychological findings have implicated medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in retaining object-location relations over the course of short delays, but MTL effects have not always been reported in neuroimaging investigations with similar short-term memory requirements. Here, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that the hippocampus and related MTL structures support accurate retention of relational memory representations, even across short delays. On every trial, four objects were presented, each in one of nine possible locations of a three-dimensional grid. Participants were to mentally rotate the grid and then maintain the rotated representation in anticipation of a test stimulus: a rendering of the grid, rotated 90{\textdegree} from the original viewpoint. The test stimulus was either a {\textquotedblleft}match{\textquotedblright} display, in which object-location relations were intact, or a {\textquotedblleft}mismatch{\textquotedblright} display, in which one object occupied a new, previously unfilled location (mismatch position), or two objects had swapped locations (mismatch swap). Encoding phase activation in anterior and posterior regions of the left hippocampus, and in bilateral perirhinal cortex, predicted subsequent accuracy on the short-term memory decision, as did bilateral posterior hippocampal activity after the test stimulus. Notably, activation in these posterior hippocampal regions was also sensitive to the degree to which object-location bindings were preserved in the test stimulus; activation was greatest for match displays, followed by mismatch-position displays, and finally mismatch-swap displays. These results indicate that the hippocampus and related MTL structures contribute to successful encoding and retrieval of relational information in visual short-term memory.",,,,,,,,,"Hannula, Deborah E. and Ranganath, Charan",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL2hhbm51bGEyMDA4am4ucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EWhhbm51bGEyMDA4am4ucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpoYW5udWxhMjAwOGpuLnBkZgAOACQAEQBoAGEAbgBuAHUAbABhADIAMAAwADgAagBuAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2hhbm51bGEyMDA4am4ucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 13:50:35 +0100,2020-11-30 13:51:25 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3086-07.2008,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/1/116.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,"medial temporal lobes, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, short-term memory, working memory, spatial memory",,,,,,,,,,,1,,,116--124,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Medial Temporal Lobe Activity Predicts Successful Relational Memory Binding,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/1/116,28,2008,
article,Hanson2004N,"Haxby et al. [Science 293 (2001) 2425] recently argued that category-related responses in the ventral temporal (VT) lobe during visual object identification were overlapping and distributed in topography. This observation contrasts with prevailing views that object codes are focal and localized to specific areas such as the fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. We provide a critical test of Haxby's hypothesis using a neural network (NN) classifier that can detect more general topographic representations and achieves 83% correct generalization performance on patterns of voxel responses in out-of-sample tests. Using voxel-wise sensitivity analysis we show that substantially the same VT lobe voxels contribute to the classification of all object categories, suggesting the code is combinatorial. Moreover, we found no evidence for local single category representations. The neural network representations of the voxel codes were sensitive to both category and superordinate level features that were only available implicitly in the object categories.",,,,,,,,,"Hanson, Stephen Jos{\'e} and Matsuka, Toshihiko and Haxby, James V.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-19 14:50:00 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.05.020,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Sep,,,1,,,156--166,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,highspeed,,Combinatorial codes in ventral temporal lobe for object recognition: Haxby (2001) revisited: is there a ``face'' area?,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.05.020,23,2004,
article,Haque2020NC,"Our memories enable us to form expectations for our future experiences, yet the precise neural mechanisms underlying how we compare any experience to our memory remain unknown. Here, using intracranial EEG recordings, we show that episodic memories formed after a single visual experience establish expectations for future experience within neocortical-medial temporal lobe circuits. When subsequent experiences violate these expectations, we find a 80--120 Hz prediction error signal that emerges in both visual association areas and the medial temporal lobe. Critically, this error signal emerges in visual association areas first and then propagates to the medial temporal lobe. This error signal is accompanied by alpha coherence between the two regions. Our data therefore suggest that internal models formed from episodic memories are generated throughout the visual hierarchy after just a single exposure, and that these internal models are then used for comparison with future experiences.",,,,,,,,,"Haque, Rafi U. and Inati, Sara K. and Levey, Allan I. and Zaghloul, Kareem A.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL2hhcXVlMjAyMG5jLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w9oYXF1ZTIwMjBuYy5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAFBERiBDQVJPAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6aGFxdWUyMDIwbmMucGRmAA4AIAAPAGgAYQBxAHUAZQAyADAAMgAwAG4AYwAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9oYXF1ZTIwMjBuYy5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,2020/11/27,,2020-12-14 11:39:11 +0100,2020-12-14 11:39:25 +0100,,,10.1038/s41467-020-19828-0,,,,,,,,,Haque2020,,2041-1723,,,,Nature Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,6075,,,,,,,,,,,,Feedforward prediction error signals during episodic memory retrieval,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19828-0,11,2020,
article,Harald-Baayen2010IJPR,"Reaction times (RTs) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of RT data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster & Dickinson, 1976). Mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the RTs. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.

article,Hard2006MC,"Everyday events, such as making a bed, can be segmented hierarchically, with the coarse level characterized by changes in the actor's goals and the fine level by subgoals (Zacks, Tversky, & Iyer, 2001). Does hierarchical event perception depend on knowledge of actors' intentions? This question was addressed by asking participants to segment films of abstract, schematic events. Films were novel or familiarized, viewed forward or backward, and simultaneously described or not. The participants interpreted familiar films as more intentional than novel films and forward films as more intentional than backward films. Regardless of experience and film direction, however, the participants identified similar event boundaries and organized them hierarchically. An analysis of the movements in each frame revealed that event segments corresponded to bursts of change in movement features, with greater bursts for coarse than for fine units.

article,Hardwicke2018RSOS,"Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (`analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25% pre-policy to 136/174, 78% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22% pre-policy to 85/136, 62%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing.

Meta-research may help calibrate the scientific ecosystem toward higher standards by providing empirical evidence that informs the iterative generation and refinement of reform initiatives. We introduce a translational framework that involves (a) identifying problems, (b) investigating problems, (c) developing solutions, and (d) evaluating solutions. In each of these areas, we review key meta-research endeavors and discuss several examples of prior and ongoing work.

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data.

It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects.

article,Harris2003N,"Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision1. A fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in information processing. According to the `cell assembly'hypothesis, transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal cognitive mechanisms2,3,4. Accordingly, neuron populations should be arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation5,6,7,8. The time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous peer activity is 10--30 ms, suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons9, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation10 and the time window for synaptic plasticity11, we propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.",,,,,,,,,"Harris, Kenneth D. and Csicsvari, Jozsef and Hirase, Hajime and Dragoi, George and Buzs{\'a}ki, Gy{\""o}rgy",,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,,,,,,,,,2003/07/01,,2021-01-21 16:07:07 +0100,2021-01-21 16:07:23 +0100,,,10.1038/nature01834,,,,,,,,,Harris2003,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6948,,,552--556,,,,,,,,,,,,Organization of cell assemblies in the hippocampus,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01834,424,2003,

Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales (<100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the PPC may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.",,,,,,,,,"Harvey, Christopher D. and Coen, Philip and Tank, David W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-08 14:27:58 +0200,2020-05-08 14:28:21 +0200,,,10.1038/nature10918,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,7392,,,62--68,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Choice-specific sequences in parietal cortex during a virtual-navigation decision task,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10918,484,2012,
article,Harvey2020CB,"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) leads to profound deficits in spatial memory and synaptic and cellular alterations to the hippocampus that last into adulthood. Neurons in the hippocampus called place cells discharge as an animal enters specific places in an environment, establish distinct ensemble codes for familiar and novel places, and are modulated by local theta rhythms. Spatial memory is thought to critically depend on the integrity of hippocampal place cell firing. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that hippocampal place cell firing is impaired after PAE by performing in vivo recordings from the hippocampi (CA1 and CA3) of moderate PAE and control adult rats. Our results show that hippocampal CA3 neurons from PAE rats have reduced spatial tuning. Second, CA1 and CA3 neurons from PAE rats are less likely to orthogonalize their firing between directions of travel on a linear track and between changes in contextual stimuli in an open arena compared to control neurons. Lastly, reductions in the number of hippocampal place cells exhibiting significant theta rhythmicity and phase precession were observed, which may suggest changes to hippocampal microcircuit function. Together, the reduced spatial tuning and sensitivity to contextual changes provide a neural systems-level mechanism to explain spatial memory impairment after moderate PAE.",,,,,,,,,"Harvey, Ryan E. and Berkowitz, Laura E. and Savage, Daniel D. and Hamilton, Derek A. and Clark, Benjamin J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-24 13:09:53 +0200,2020-07-24 14:31:48 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.077,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Altered Hippocampal Place Cell Representation and Theta Rhythmicity following Moderate Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.077,,2020,

We tested whether a group of amnesic patients with primary damage to the hippocampus bilaterally could construct new imagined experiences in response to short verbal cues that outlined a range of simple commonplace scenarios. Our results revealed that patients were markedly impaired relative to matched control subjects at imagining new experiences. Moreover, we identified a possible source for this deficit. The patients{\textquoteright} imagined experiences lacked spatial coherence, consisting instead of fragmented images in the absence of a holistic representation of the environmental setting. The hippocampus, therefore, may make a critical contribution to the creation of new experiences by providing the spatial context into which the disparate elements of an experience can be bound.

article,Haufe2014N,"The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain--computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses.",,,,,,,,,"Haufe, Stefan and Meinecke, Frank and G{\""o}rgen, Kai and D{\""a}hne, Sven and Haynes, John-Dylan and Blankertz, Benjamin and Bie{\ss}mann, Felix",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-22 14:18:55 +0200,2020-07-22 14:19:33 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.067,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,,,,96--110,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,On the interpretation of weight vectors of linear models in multivariate neuroimaging,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.067,87,2014,

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate techniques, we studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of task and object processing. Our results reveal a sequence of separate but overlapping task-related processes spread across frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex. Task exhibited late effects on object processing by selectively enhancing task-relevant object features, with limited impact on the overall pattern of object representations. Combining MEG and fMRI data, we reveal a parallel rise in task-related signals throughout the cerebral cortex, with an increasing dominance of task over object representations from early to higher visual areas.

To investigate the effect of limited memory ability on the reporting of internal states, S's performance was compared with that of 5 other Ss (aged 22--48 yrs) with global amnesia. 19 22--74 yr old normal controls were also assessed.

Conditions that promote rapid cortical learning include relatedness to prior knowledge, activation of knowledge in the service of action selection or active discovery, and repeated retrieval.

Systems-level memory consolidation is thought to be dependent on the coordinated interplay of cortical slow waves, thalamo-cortical sleep spindles and hippocampal ripple oscillations. However, it is currently unclear how the selective interaction of these cardinal sleep oscillations is organized to support information reactivation and transfer. Here, using human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the prefrontal cortex plays a key role in organizing the ripple-mediated information transfer during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We reveal a temporally precise form of coupling between prefrontal slow-wave and spindle oscillations, which actively dictates the hippocampal-neocortical dialogue and information transfer.

article,Heller2020JP,"Emotional learning (learning the value of stimuli or contexts) is central to the causative mechanisms of mood and anxiety disorders. During emotional learning, the hippocampus, long implicated in internalizing disorders, receives a snapshot of distributed cortical and subcortical activity. Synaptic plasticity promotes engram formation, the circuit-level instantiation of memory.1 Hippocampal replay, the rapid, coordinated reactivation of encoding-activated cellular ensembles during sleep and resting wakefulness, also supports memory consolidation2 and may contribute to prospection and decision-making. Even in rodent cognitive spatial tasks, learning fundamentally concerns the learning of value, a process critical to psychopathology. While unstudied (to our knowledge) in psychiatric disorders, hippocampal replay abnormalities may critically link animal models with human psychopathology and, in particular, with cognitive symptoms of worry and rumination. Hippocampal replay2 is marked by ripple oscillations in the CA1 local field potential1 of approximately 100 milliseconds at 140 to 250 Hz.2 During replay, which is commonly observed after a rodent traverses a maze (reverse replay) or before it enters a familiar maze (forward replay), the hippocampal firing sequence recapitulates previously observed firing but is accelerated.2 Reverse replay is not observed before an initial maze run, suggesting that replay represents previous experience. Forward replay is observed when, as the rodent approaches a decision point in a familiar maze, hippocampal place cells replay forward the sequences observed previously from that maze.3 Forward replay is associated with the rodent's ultimate trajectory, potentially representing goal-directed future planning in anticipation of decision-making.3 Hippocampal replay is the replay that has been most extensively studied, yet there is evidence that replay occurs elsewhere, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the medial PFC (mPFC). While most evidence supports replay-associated CA1 sharp-wave ripples originating in the CA3, recent findings suggest a role for bidirectional mPFC-hippocampus communication in initiating and, in particular, sustaining replay.4",,,,,,,,,"Heller, Aaron S. and Bagot, Rosemary C.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-07 10:30:49 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.4788,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-622X,,,JAMA Psychiatry,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,,,,,,,,American Medical Association (AMA),,,,,,replay; computational ; disorders,,Is Hippocampal Replay a Mechanism for Anxiety and Depression?,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.4788,,2020,

In this report, we studied the effect of smoothing on MVPA results in a motor paradigm. Subjects pressed four buttons with two different fingers of the two hands in response to auditory commands. Overall, independent of the degree of smoothing, correlational MVPA showed distinctive patterns for the different hands in all studied regions of interest (motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and auditory cortices). With regard to the effect of smoothing, our findings suggest that results from correlational MVPA show a minor sensitivity to smoothing. Moderate amounts of smoothing (in this case, 1−4 times the voxel size) improved MVPA correlations, from a slight improvement to large improvements depending on the region involved. None of the regions showed signs of a detrimental effect of moderate levels of smoothing. Even higher amounts of smoothing sometimes had a positive effect, most clearly in low-level auditory cortex.

article,Henin2020B,"Sensory input arrives in continuous sequences that humans experience as units, e.g., words and events. The brain{\textquoteright}s ability to discover extrinsic regularities is called statistical learning. Structure can be represented at multiple levels, including transitional probabilities, ordinal position, and identity of units. To investigate sequence encoding in cortex and hippocampus, we recorded from intracranial electrodes in human subjects as they were exposed to auditory and visual sequences containing temporal regularities. We find neural tracking of regularities within minutes, with characteristic profiles across brain areas. Early processing tracked lower-level features (e.g., syllables) and learned units (e.g., words); while later processing tracked only learned units. Learning rapidly shaped neural representations, with a gradient of complexity from early brain areas encoding transitional probability, to associative regions and hippocampus encoding ordinal position and identity of units. These findings indicate the existence of multiple, parallel computational systems for sequence learning across hierarchically organized cortico-hippocampal circuits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Henin, Simon and Turk-Browne, Nicholas B. and Friedman, Daniel and Liu, Anli and Dugan, Patricia and Flinker, Adeen and Doyle, Werner and Devinsky, Orrin and Melloni, Lucia",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-22 14:27:46 +0100,2021-01-22 14:28:08 +0100,,,10.1101/583856,,,,,583856,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/05/11/583856.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,statistical learning,,Learning hierarchical sequence representations across human cortex and hippocampus,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/05/11/583856,,2020,

article,Hennings2020P,"An adaptive memory system should prioritize select information surrounding a powerful learning event that may prove useful for predicting future meaningful events. The behavioral tagging hypothesis provides a mechanistic framework to interpret how weak experiences persist as durable memories through temporal association with a strong experience. Importantly, memories are composed of multiple elements, and different mnemonic aspects of the same experience may be uniquely affected by mechanisms that retroactively modulate weakly encoded memory. Here we investigated how emotional learning affects item and source memory for related events encoded close in time. Participants encoded trial-unique category exemplars before, during, and after Pavlovian fear conditioning. Results showed selective retroactive enhancements in 24-hour item memory were accompanied by a bias to misattribute items to the temporal context of fear conditioning. The strength of this source memory bias correlated with participants' retroactive item memory enhancement, and source misattribution to the emotional context predicted whether items were remembered overall. In the framework of behavioral tagging: memory attribution was biased to the temporal context of the stronger event (fear conditioning) that provided the putative source of memory stabilization for the weaker event (non-emotional learning). We additionally found that fear conditioning selectively and retroactively enhanced stimulus typicality ratings for related items, and that stimulus typicality also predicted overall item memory. Collectively, these results provide new evidence that items related to an emotional event are misattributed to the temporal context of the emotional event and judged to be more representative of their semantic category.

article,Henriksson2015N,"Intrinsic cortical dynamics are thought to underlie trial-to-trial variability of visually evoked responses in animal models. Understanding their function in the context of sensory processing and representation is a major current challenge. Here we report that intrinsic cortical dynamics strongly affect the representational geometry of a brain region, as reflected in response-pattern dissimilarities, and exaggerate the similarity of representations between brain regions. We characterized the representations in several human visual areas by representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from fMRI response-patterns for natural image stimuli. The RDMs of different visual areas were highly similar when the response-patterns were estimated on the basis of the same trials (sharing intrinsic cortical dynamics), and quite distinct when patterns were estimated on the basis of separate trials (sharing only the stimulus-driven component). We show that the greater similarity of the representational geometries can be explained by coherent fluctuations of regional-mean activation within visual cortex, reflecting intrinsic dynamics. Using separate trials to study stimulus-driven representations revealed clearer distinctions between the representational geometries: a Gabor wavelet pyramid model explained representational geometry in visual areas V1--3 and a categorical animate--inanimate model in the object-responsive lateral occipital cortex.",,,,,,,,,"Henriksson, Linda and Khaligh-Razavi, Seyed-Mahdi and Kay, Kendrick and Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 13:01:33 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.026,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,275--286,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Visual representations are dominated by intrinsic fluctuations correlated between areas,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.026,114,2015,
article,Hermans2016CC,"After encoding, memories undergo a process of consolidation that determines long-term retention. For conditioned fear, animal models postulate that consolidation involves reactivations of neuronal assemblies supporting fear learning during postlearning ``offline'' periods. However, no human studies to date have investigated such processes, particularly in relation to long-term expression of fear. We tested 24 participants using functional MRI on 2 consecutive days in a fear conditioning paradigm involving 1 habituation block, 2 acquisition blocks, and 2 extinction blocks on day 1, and 2 re-extinction blocks on day 2. Conditioning blocks were preceded and followed by 4.5-min rest blocks. Strength of spontaneous recovery of fear on day 2 served as a measure of long-term expression of fear. Amygdala connectivity primarily with hippocampus increased progressively during postacquisition and postextinction rest on day 1. Intraregional multi-voxel correlation structures within amygdala and hippocampus sampled during a block of differential fear conditioning furthermore persisted after fear learning. Critically, both these main findings were stronger in participants who exhibited spontaneous recovery 24 h later. Our findings indicate that neural circuits activated during fear conditioning exhibit persistent postlearning activity that may be functionally relevant in promoting consolidation of the fear memory.",,,,,,,,,"Hermans, Erno J. and Kanen, Jonathan W. and Tambini, Arielle and Fern{\'a}ndez, Guill{\'e}n and Davachi, Lila and Phelps, Elizabeth A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-27 17:31:26 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1093/cercor/bhw145,,,,,,,,,,,,1460-2199,,,Cerebral Cortex,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,,,,bhw145,,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),,,,,,replay,,Persistence of Amygdala--Hippocampal Connectivity and Multi-Voxel Correlation Structures During Awake Rest After Fear Learning Predicts Long-Term Expression of Fear,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhw145,,2016,

Within the assumptions of the General Linear Model, we explore the tolerance of regression analyses of fMRI data to errors in the timing of the model relative to the experimental data under a number of circumstances. Given the sensitivity of the analysis to temporal shifts of the model relative to the data, one can search for the time a neuronal event occurs with temporal resolution on the order of a few hundred milliseconds with 95% confidence.

article,Herszage2018N,"The human brain is known by its ability to modify and update existing memories, mediated by underlying neuronal plasticity. This ability is facilitated by two main phenomena, interference and generalization. Interference occurs when a new memory harms, or is being harmed by, a different memory that was acquired in temporal proximity to it. Generalization on the other hand, refers to the case in which a learned memory is expanded beyond its specific properties. While each of these two phenomena may be well known separately, we review recent evidence primarily in perceptual and motor skill memory, spanning synaptic, neural systems-level, and behavioral research, suggesting that although the outcomes are different, the underlying neural and behavioral processes responsible for their inducements share numerous commonalities.

Models propose that sequence encoding is supported by interactions between high- and low-frequency oscillations, such that elements within an experience are represented by neural cell assemblies firing at higher frequencies (gamma) and sequential order is encoded by the specific timing of firing with respect to a lower frequency oscillation (theta). During episodic sequence memory formation in humans, we provide evidence that items in different sequence positions exhibit greater gamma power along distinct phases of a theta oscillation. Furthermore, this segregation is related to successful temporal order memory.

article,Ho2019COBS,"Agents that can make better use of computation, experience, time, and memory can solve a greater range of problems more effectively. A crucial ingredient for managing such finite resources is intelligently chosen abstract representations. But, how do abstractions facilitate problem solving under limited resources? What makes an abstraction useful? To answer such questions, we review several trends in recent reinforcement-learning research that provide insight into how abstractions interact with learning and decision making. During learning, abstraction can guide exploration and generalization as well as facilitate efficient tradeoffs---e.g., time spent learning versus the quality of a solution. During computation, good abstractions provide simplified models for reasoning that preserve information that is relevant for making good decisions. These features of abstraction are not only key for scaling up artificial problem solving, but can also shed light on what pressures shape the use of abstract representations in humans and other organisms.",,,,,,,,,"Ho, Mark K and Abel, David and Griffiths, Thomas L and Littman, Michael L",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-17 10:50:41 +0200,2020-04-17 10:52:03 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.05.001,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-1546,,,Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,,,,111--116,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,The value of abstraction,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.05.001,29,2019,

In this review, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment are discussed. While aetiology of the epilepsy has a significant influence on cognition, there is increasing evidence that prolonged or recurrent seizures can cause or exacerbate cognitive impairment.

Functional studies of neuronal assemblies have progressed dramatically thanks to recent technological advances. Here we discuss how a focus on assembly formation and consolidation has provided a powerful conceptual framework to relate mechanistic studies of synaptic and circuit plasticity to behaviorally relevant aspects of learning and memory. Neurons are likely recruited to particular learning-related assemblies as a function of their relative excitabilities and synaptic activation, followed by selective strengthening of pre-existing synapses, formation of new connections and elimination of outcompeted synapses to ensure memory formation. Mechanistically, these processes involve linking transcription to circuit modification.

article,Honor2016FN,"Data sharing and reuse, while widely accepted as good ideas, have been slow to catch on in any concrete and consistent way. One major hurdle within the scientific community has been the lack of widely accepted standards for citing that data, making it difficult to track usage and measure impact. Within the neuroimaging community, there is a need for a way to not only clearly identify and cite datasets, but also to derive new aggregate sets from multiple sources while clearly maintaining lines of attribution. This work presents a functional prototype of a system to integrate Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and a standardized metadata schema into a XNAT-based repository workflow, allowing for identification of data at both the project and image level. These item and source level identifiers allow any newly defined combination of images, from any number of projects, to be tagged with a new group-level DOI that automatically inherits the individual attributes and provenance information of its constituent parts. This system enables the tracking of data reuse down to the level of individual images. The implementation of this type of data identification system would impact researchers and data creators, data hosting facilities, and data publishers, but the benefit of having widely accepted standards for data identification and attribution would go far toward making data citation practical and advantageous.",,,,,,,,,"Honor, Leah B. and Haselgrove, Christian and Frazier, Jean A. and Kennedy, David N.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 16:05:36 +0200,2020-06-11 16:05:57 +0200,,,10.3389/fninf.2016.00034,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5196,,,Frontiers in Neuroinformatics,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,,,Data Citation in Neuroimaging: Proposed Best Practices for Data Identification and Attribution,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034,10,2016,

article,Hopfield2010PNAS,"Thinking allows an animal to take an effective action in a novel situation based on a mental exploration of possibilities and previous knowledge. We describe a model animal, with a neural system based loosely on the rodent hippocampus, which performs mental exploration to find a useful route in a spatial world it has previously learned. It then mentally recapitulates the chosen route, and this intent is converted to motor acts that move the animal physically along the route. The modeling is based on spiking neurons with spike-frequency adaptation. Adaptation causes the continuing evolution in the pattern of neural activity that is essential to mental exploration. A successful mental exploration is remembered through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity.

article,Horner2016CB,"Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of rodents [1] and humans [2] fire in a hexagonally distributed spatially periodic manner. In concert with other spatial cells in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) [3, 4, 5, 6], they provide a representation of our location within an environment [7, 8] and are specifically thought to allow the represented location to be updated by self-motion [9]. Grid-like signals have been seen throughout the autobiographical memory system [10], suggesting a much more general role in memory [11, 12]. Grid cells may allow us to move our viewpoint in imagination [13], a useful function for goal-directed navigation and planning [12, 14, 15, 16], and episodic future thinking more generally [17, 18]. We used fMRI to provide evidence for similar grid-like signals in human entorhinal cortex during both virtual navigation and imagined navigation of the same paths. We show that this signal is present in periods of active navigation and imagination, with a similar orientation in both and with the specifically 6-fold rotational symmetry characteristic of grid cell firing.

article,Hosseini2020NBR,"Machine learning has enhanced the abilities of neuroscientists to interpret information collected through EEG, fMRI, and MEG data. With these powerful techniques comes the danger of overfitting of hyperparameters which can render results invalid. We refer to this problem as `overhyping' and show that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions. Overhyping occurs when analysis decisions are made after observing analysis outcomes and can produce results that are partially or even completely spurious. It is commonly assumed that cross-validation is an effective protection against overfitting or overhyping, but this is not actually true. In this article, we show that spurious results can be obtained on random data by modifying hyperparameters in seemingly innocuous ways, despite the use of cross-validation. We recommend a number of techniques for limiting overhyping, such as lock boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields that use machine learning, including computer science and physics.

article,Howard2019B,"The standard theory of memory consolidation posits a dual-store memory system: a fast-learning fast-decaying hippocampus that transfers memories to slow-learning long-term cortical storage. Hippocampal lesions interrupt this transfer, so recent memories are more likely to be lost than more remote memories. Existing models of memory consolidation that simulate this temporally graded retrograde amnesia operate only on static patterns or unitary variables as memories. However, the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of episodes, which are sequential in nature and comprise multiple events, are not well understood. There is currently no computational theory for how memory replays of sequential experiences emerge dynamically during offline periods and how they are coordinated between the hippocampus and cortex to facilitate the stabilization of episodic memories. Further, there is evidence for a bi-directional interaction between the two memory systems during offline periods (Ji & Wilson, 2007), whereby the reactivation of waking neural patterns originating in the cortex triggers time-compressed sequential replays in the hippocampus, which in turn drive the consolidation of the pertinent sequence in the cortex. We have developed a computational model of memory encoding, consolidation, and recall for storing temporal sequences that explores the dynamics of this bi-directional interaction and time-compressed replays in four simulation experiments, providing novel insights into whether hippocampal learning needs to be suppressed for stable memory consolidation and into how new and old memories compete for limited replay opportunities during offline periods. The salience of experienced events, based on factors such as recency and frequency of use, is shown to have considerable impact on memory consolidation because it biases the relative probability that a particular event will be cued in the cortex during offline periods. In the presence of hippocampal learning during sleep, our model predicts that the fast-forgetting hippocampus can continually refresh the memory traces of a given episodic sequence if there are no competing experiences to be replayed.",,,,,,,,,"Howard, Michael D. and Skorheim, Steven W. and Pilly, Praveen K.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-16 12:38:03 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1101/2019.12.19.882035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,replay; modeling; memory consolidation,,A model of bidirectional interactions between complementary learning systems for memory consolidation of sequential experiences,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.19.882035,,2019,

One fundamental question concerns whether the hippocampus represents specific objects or assigns context-dependent representations to objects. Here, we used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis of fMRI data during retrieval of learned object sequences to systematically investigate hippocampal coding of object and temporal context information. Hippocampal activity patterns carried information about the temporal positions of objects in learned sequences, but not about objects or temporal positions in random sequences. Hippocampal activity patterns differentiated between overlapping object sequences and between temporally adjacent objects that belonged to distinct sequence contexts. Parahippocampal and perirhinal cortex showed different pattern information profiles consistent with coding of temporal position and object information, respectively.

article,Huang2018E,"Storing temporal sequences of events (i.e., sequence memory) is fundamental to many cognitive functions. However, it is unknown how the sequence order information is maintained and represented in working memory and its behavioral significance, particularly in human subjects. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with a temporal response function (TRF) method to dissociate item-specific neuronal reactivations. We demonstrate that serially remembered items are successively reactivated during memory retention. The sequential replay displays two interesting properties compared to the actual sequence. First, the item-by-item reactivation is compressed within a 200 -- 400 ms window, suggesting that external events are associated within a plasticity-relevant window to facilitate memory consolidation. Second, the replay is in a temporally reversed order and is strongly related to the recency effect in behavior.

article,Huang1995PNAS,"Agonists of the dopamine D1/D5 receptors that are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase specifically induce a slowly developing long-lasting potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that lasts for \&gt; 6 hr. This potentiation is blocked by the specific D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and is occluded by the potentiation induced by cAMP agonists. An agonist of the D2 receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through G alpha i, did not induce potentiation. Although this slow D1/D5 agonist-induced potentiation is partially independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, it seems to share some steps with and is occluded by the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) produced by three repeated trains of nerve stimuli applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Similarly, the D1/D5 antagonist SCH 23390 attenuates the late phase of the LTP induced by repeated trains, and the D1/D5 agonist-induced potentiation is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. These results suggest that the D1/D5 receptor may be involved in the late, protein synthesis-dependent component of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region, either as an ancillary component or as a mediator directly contributing to the late phase.",,,,,,,,,"Huang, Y Y and Kandel, E R",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-13 14:34:43 +0100,2021-01-13 14:35:00 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.92.7.2446,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/7/2446.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,2446--2450,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,D1/D5 receptor agonists induce a protein synthesis-dependent late potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/7/2446,92,1995,
article,Huettel2000N,"We investigated the effects of paired presentations of visual stimuli upon the evoked hemodynamic response of visual cortex measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Stimuli were identical 500-ms high-contrast checkerboard patterns, presented singly or with an interpair interval (IPI) of 1, 2, 4, or 6 s (onset-to-onset), followed by an intertrial interval of 16--20 s. Images were acquired at 1.5 Tesla using a gradient-echo echoplanar imaging sequence sensitive to blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) contrast. Single checkerboards evoked a hemodynamic response from visual cortex characterized by a rise at 3 s, peak activation at 5 s, and return to baseline by 10 s. We subtracted subjects' single-stimulus hemodynamic response from their paired-stimulus responses to isolate the contribution of the second stimulus. If the hemodynamic responses were fully additive, the residual should be a time-shifted replica of the single stimulus response. However, the amplitude of the hemodynamic response to the second checkerboard was smaller, and the peak latency was longer, than for the first. Furthermore, the amplitude decrement was dependent upon IPI, such that the response to the second stimulus at 1 s IPI was only 55% of that to a single stimulus, with recovery to 90% at a 6 s IPI. Peak latency was similarly dependent upon IPI with longer latencies observed for shorter IPIs.

article,Hulbert2014CC,"{Selective retrieval of overlapping memories can generate competition. How does the brain adaptively resolve this competition? One possibility is that competing memories are inhibited; in support of this view, numerous studies have found that selective retrieval leads to forgetting of memories that are related to the just-retrieved memory. However, this retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) effect can be eliminated or even reversed if participants are given opportunities to restudy the materials between retrieval attempts. Here, we outline an explanation for such a reversal, rooted in a neural network model of RIF that predicts representational differentiation when restudy is interleaved with selective retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we measured changes in pattern similarity of the BOLD fMRI signal elicited by related memories after undergoing interleaved competitive retrieval and restudy. Reduced pattern similarity within the hippocampus positively correlated with retrieval-induced facilitation of competing memories. This result is consistent with an adaptive differentiation process that allows individuals to learn to distinguish between once-confusable memories.}",,,,,,,,,"Hulbert, J. C. and Norman, K.

article,Hussin2020H,"Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are spontaneous, synchronized neural population events in the hippocampus widely thought to play a role in memory consolidation and retrieval. They occur predominantly in sleep and quiet immobility, and in primates, they also appear during active visual exploration. Typical measures of SWRs in behaving rats include changes in the rate of occurrence, or in the incidence of specific neural ensemble activity contained within the categorical SWR event. Much less is known about the relevance of spatiotemporal SWR features, though they may index underlying activity of specific cell types including ensemble-specific internally generated sequences. Furthermore, changes in SWR features during active exploratory states are unknown. In this study, we recorded hippocampal local-field potentials and single-units during periods of quiescence and as macaques performed a memory-guided visual search task. We observed that (a) ripples during quiescence have greater amplitudes and larger postripple waves (PRW) compared to those in task epochs, and (b) during ``remembered'' trials, ripples have larger amplitudes than during ``forgotten'' trials, with no change in duration or PRWs. We further found that spiking activity influences SWR features as a function of cell type and ripple timing. As expected, larger ripple amplitudes were associated with putative pyramidal or putative basket interneuron (IN) activity, even when the spikes in question exceed the duration of the ripple. In contrast, the PRW was attenuated with activity from low firing rate cells and enhanced with activity from high firing rate cells, with putative IN spikes during ripples leading to the most prominent PRW peaks. The selective changes in SWR features as a function of time window, cell type, and cognitive/vigilance states suggest that this mesoscopic field event can offer additional information about the local network and animal's state than would be appreciated from SWR event rates alone.",,,,,,,,,"Hussin, Ahmed T. and Leonard, Timothy K. and Hoffman, Kari L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-09 07:53:28 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.23046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"bursting, electrophysiology, hippocampus, local field potential, memory, nonhuman primate",,,,,,,,,,,1,,,50-59,,,,,,,,,,ripples; replay,,Sharp-wave ripple features in macaques depend on behavioral state and cell-type specific firing,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23046,30,2020,

article,Igata2020B,"Hippocampal cells are central to spatial and predictive representations, and experience replays by place cells are crucial for learning and memory. Nonetheless, how hippocampal replay patterns dynamically change during the learning process remains to be largely elucidated. We found that when rats updated their behavioral strategies in response to a novel salient location, place cells increased theta sequences and sharp wave ripple-associated synchronous spikes that preferentially replayed salient locations and reward-related contexts in reverse order.

article,Igata2021PNAS,"The hippocampus is crucial for spatial learning but their neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we found that hippocampal cell ensembles preferentially replayed salient reward-related locations as rats learned a new behavioral trajectory for reward. The contents of these hippocampal replays progressively varied with learning. Especially during learning, hippocampal neurons even replayed an optimized path that had never been exploited by the animals. The learning-related hippocampal activity was necessary for the stabilization of spatial behavior. These results suggest prioritized replays of significant experiences on a predictive map by hippocampal neurons.Hippocampal cells are central to spatial and predictive representations, and experience replays by place cells are crucial for learning and memory. Nonetheless, how hippocampal replay patterns dynamically change during the learning process remains to be elucidated. Here, we designed a spatial task in which rats learned a new behavioral trajectory for reward. We found that as rats updated their behavioral strategies for a novel salient location, hippocampal cell ensembles increased theta-sequences and sharp wave ripple-associated synchronous spikes that preferentially replayed salient locations and reward-related contexts in reverse order. The directionality and contents of the replays progressively varied with learning, including an optimized path that had never been exploited by the animals, suggesting prioritized replays of significant experiences on a predictive map. Online feedback blockade of sharp wave ripples during a learning process inhibited stabilizing optimized behavior.

In this study, we investigated the problem-solving behaviors of mice in a complicated maze in which multiple routes with different intersections were available (Test 1). Although all mice eventually settled on the shortest route, mice that initially exhibited more trial-and-error exploration solved the maze more rapidly. We then introduced one or two barriers that obstructed learned routes such that mice had to establish novel roundabout detours (Tests 2/3). Solutions varied among mice but were predictable based on individual early trial-and-error patterns observed in Test 1: mice that had initially explored more extensively found better solutions. Finally, when the barriers were removed (Test 4), all mice reverted to the best solution after active exploration.

Yet, how our brain selects the noteworthy information that will be consolidated during sleep remains largely unknown. Here we show that post-learning sleep favors the selectivity of long-term consolidation: when tested three months after initial encoding, the most important (i.e., rewarded, strongly encoded) memories are better retained, and also remembered with higher subjective confidence. Our brain imaging data reveals that the functional interplay between dopaminergic reward regions, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus contributes to the integration of rewarded associative memories. We further show that sleep spindles strengthen memory representations based on reward values, suggesting a privileged replay of information yielding positive outcomes.

article,Ioannidis2005PM,"There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true.

These reactivations occur during transient local field potential (LFP) events, termed sharp waves. Theories of hippocampal processing suggest that sharp waves arise from strengthened plasticity, and that the strengthened plasticity depends on repeated cofiring of pyramidal cells. We tested these predictions by recording neural ensembles and LFPs from rats running tasks requiring different levels of behavioral repetition. The number of sharp waves emitted increased during sessions with more regular behaviors. Reactivation became more similar to behavioral firing patterns across the session. This enhanced reactivation also depended on the regularity of the behavior.

We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact.

article,Jadhav2016N,"Interactions between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical for learning and memory. Hippocampal activity during awake sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events is important for spatial learning, and hippocampal SWR activity often represents past or potential future experiences. Whether or how this reactivation engages the PFC, and how reactivation might interact with ongoing patterns of PFC activity, remains unclear. We recorded hippocampal CA1 and PFC activity in animals learning spatial tasks and found that many PFC cells showed spiking modulation during SWRs. Unlike in CA1, SWR-related activity in PFC comprised both excitation and inhibition of distinct populations. Within individual SWRs, excitation activated PFC cells with representations related to the concurrently reactivated hippocampal representation, while inhibition suppressed PFC cells with unrelated representations. Thus, awake SWRs mark times of strong coordination between hippocampus and PFC that reflects structured reactivation of representations related to ongoing experience.",,,,,,,,,"Jadhav, Shantanu P. and Rothschild, Gideon and Roumis, Demetris K. and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 10:13:46 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.010,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,1,,,113--127,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Coordinated Excitation and Inhibition of Prefrontal Ensembles during Awake Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripple Events,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.010,90,2016,
article,Jaeger2008JML,"This paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of ANOVAs for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. & Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9--25]), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis.

article,Jafarpour2013JN,"Long-term memories are linked to cortical representations of perceived events, but it is unclear which types of representations can later be recollected. Using magnetoencephalography-based decoding, we examined which brain activity patterns elicited during encoding are later replayed during recollection in the human brain. The results show that the recollection of images depicting faces and scenes is associated with a replay of neural representations that are formed at very early (180 ms) stages of encoding. This replay occurs quite rapidly, ∼500 ms after the onset of a cue that prompts recollection and correlates with source memory accuracy. Therefore, long-term memories are rapidly replayed during recollection and involve representations that were formed at very early stages of encoding. These findings indicate that very early representational information can be preserved in the memory engram and can be faithfully and rapidly reinstated during recollection.

article,Jafarpour2017E,"One view of working memory posits that maintaining a series of events requires their sequential and equal mnemonic replay. Another view is that the content of working memory maintenance is prioritized by attention. We decoded the dynamics for retaining a sequence of items using magnetoencephalography, wherein participants encoded sequences of three stimuli depicting a face, a manufactured object, or a natural item and maintained them in working memory for 5000 ms. Memory for sequence position and stimulus details were probed at the end of the maintenance period. Decoding of brain activity revealed that one of the three stimuli dominated maintenance independent of its sequence position or category; and memory was enhanced for the selectively replayed stimulus. Analysis of event-related responses during the encoding of the sequence showed that the selectively replayed stimuli were determined by the degree of attention at encoding. The selectively replayed stimuli had the weakest initial encoding indexed by weaker visual attention signals at encoding. These findings do not rule out sequential mnemonic replay but reveal that attention influences the content of working memory maintenance by prioritizing replay of weakly encoded events. We propose that the prioritization of weakly encoded stimuli protects them from interference during the maintenance period, whereas the more strongly encoded stimuli can be retrieved from long-term memory at the end of the delay period.",,,,,,,,,"Jafarpour, Anna and Penny, Will and Barnes, Gareth and Knight, Robert T. and Duzel, Emrah",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 14:53:38 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1523/eneuro.0171-17.2017,,,,,,,,,,,,2373-2822,,,eNeuro,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,4,,,1--11,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,replay; MEG,,Working Memory Replay Prioritizes Weakly Attended Events,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0171-17.2017,4,2017,
article,Jarosiewicz2004JN,"In the actively foraging rat, hippocampal pyramidal cells have strong spatial correlates. Each {\textquotedblleft}place cell{\textquotedblright} fires rapidly only when the rat enters a particular delimited portion of its environment, called the {\textquotedblleft}place field{\textquotedblright} of that cell. Hippocampal pyramidal cells also exhibit spatial selectivity during a physiological state that occurs during sleep, termed {\textquotedblleft}small irregular activity{\textquotedblright} (SIA), because of the appearance of the hippocampal EEG. It is not known whether rats determine their current location in space during SIA using current visual information or whether they recall the location in which they fell asleep. To address this question, we recorded spikes from ensembles of CA1 pyramidal cells and hippocampal EEG while rats slept along the edge of a large circular recording arena with minimal local features in a room with prominent distal visual cues. To move the rats to a new location in the room while they were sleeping, we slowly rotated the recording arena on which they slept to a new orientation in the room. Hippocampal place cell activity in subsequent SIA episodes reflected the location in the room in which the rats fell asleep, rather than the location to which they were moved, although the alignment of the rats{\textquoteright} spatial map was governed by the room cues in the subsequent active foraging session. Thus, the hippocampal population activity during SIA does not result from the processing of current visual information but instead probably reflects a memory for the location in which the rat fell asleep.",,,,,,,,,"Jarosiewicz, Beata and Skaggs, William E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-25 14:44:16 +0100,2021-01-25 14:44:32 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5650-03.2004,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/21/5070.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,,,5070--5077,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Hippocampal Place Cells Are Not Controlled by Visual Input during the Small Irregular Activity State in the Rat,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/21/5070,24,2004,

The results indicated that rats with the hippocampus removed were impaired on those tasks that require the utilization of spatial and contextual information but performed like controls in learning about and handling (even complex) non-spatial information.

This review will focus on dopamine contribution to synaptic plasticity in different brain areas (hippocampus, striatum and prefrontal cortex) with, for each region, a few lines on the distribution of DA projections and receptors. New insights into the possible mechanisms underlying these plastic changes will be considered. The contribution of various DA systems in certain forms of learning and memory will be reviewed with recent advances supporting the hypothesis of similar cellular mechanisms underlying DA regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory processes in which the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway has a potential role.

article,Jenkinson2002N,"Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global--local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.",,,,,,,,,"Jenkinson, Mark and Bannister, Peter and Brady, Michael and Smith, Stephen",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-13 16:15:33 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1006/nimg.2002.1132,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,2,,,825--841,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,fmriprep,,Improved Optimization for the Robust and Accurate Linear Registration and Motion Correction of Brain Images,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2002.1132,17,2002,
article,Jensen2005TN,"Encoding and recall of memory sequences is an important process. Memory encoding is thought to occur by long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus; however, it remains unclear how LTP, which has a time window for induction of ∼100 ms, could encode the linkage between sequential items that arrive with a temporal separation >100 ms. Here, we argue that LTP can underlie the learning of such memory sequences, provided the input to the hippocampus is from a cortical multi-item working memory buffer in which theta and gamma oscillations have an important role. In such a buffer, memory items that occurred seconds apart are represented with a temporal separation of 20--30 ms, thereby bringing them within the LTP window.

However, whether temporally structured replay occurs in the cortex and whether the replay events in the two areas are related are unknown. Here we studied multicell spiking patterns in both the visual cortex and hippocampus during slow-wave sleep in rats. We found that spiking patterns not only in the cortex but also in the hippocampus were organized into frames, defined as periods of stepwise increase in neuronal population activity. The multicell firing sequences evoked by awake experience were replayed during these frames in both regions. Furthermore, replay events in the sensory cortex and hippocampus were coordinated to reflect the same experience.

Past experience provides one source of knowledge about likely task demands in the present, with learning enabling future predictions about anticipated demands. We examine whether spatial contexts serve to cue retrieval of associated task demands (e.g., context A and B probabilistically cue retrieval of task demands X and Y, respectively), and the role of the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in mediating such retrieval. Using 3D virtual environments, we induce context-task demand probabilistic associations and find that learned associations affect goal-directed behavior. Concurrent fMRI data reveal that, upon entering a context, differences between hippocampal representations of contexts (i.e., neural pattern separability) predict proactive retrieval of the probabilistically dominant associated task demand, which is reinstated in dlPFC.

article,Jiang2017SR,"Animal studies support the hypothesis that in slow-wave sleep, replay of waking neocortical activity under hippocampal guidance leads to memory consolidation. However, no intracranial electrophysiological evidence for replay exists in humans. We identified consistent sequences of population firing peaks across widespread cortical regions during complete waking periods. The occurrence of these ``Motifs'' were compared between sleeps preceding the waking period (``Sleep-Pre'') when the Motifs were identified, and those following (``Sleep-Post''). In all subjects, the majority of waking Motifs (most of which were novel) had more matches in Sleep-Post than in Sleep-Pre. In rodents, hippocampal replay occurs during local sharp-wave ripples, and the associated neocortical replay tends to occur during local sleep spindles and down-to-up transitions. These waves may facilitate consolidation by sequencing cell-firing and encouraging plasticity. Similarly, we found that Motifs were coupled to neocortical spindles, down-to-up transitions, theta bursts, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. While Motifs occurring during cognitive task performance were more likely to have more matches in subsequent sleep, our studies provide no direct demonstration that the replay of Motifs contributes to consolidation. Nonetheless, these results confirm a core prediction of the dominant neurobiological theory of human memory consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Jiang, Xi and Shamie, Isaac and K.

We manipulated the expected probe time in a delayed change-detection task and report that temporal expectation can have a profound influence on memory-guided behavioral performance. EEG measurements corroborated the utilization of temporal expectations: demonstrating the involvement of a classic EEG signature of temporal expectation---the contingent negative variation---in the context of working memory. We also report the influence of temporal expectations on 2 EEG signatures associated with visual working memory---the lateralization of 8- to 12-Hz alpha activity, and the contralateral delay activity. We observed a dissociation between these signatures, whereby alpha lateralization (but not the contralateral delay activity) adapted to the time of expected memory utilization.

article,Joechner2020B,"In young adults, memory consolidation during sleep is supported by a time-coordinated interplay of sleep spindles and slow oscillations. However, given tremendous developmental changes in sleep spindle and slow oscillation morphology, it remains elusive whether the same mechanisms as identified in young adults are comparably functional across childhood. Here, we characterise slow and fast sleep spindles and their temporal coupling to slow oscillations in 24 pre-school children. Further, we ask whether slow and fast sleep spindles and their modulation during slow oscillations are similarly associated with behavioural indicators of declarative memory consolidation as suggested from adult literature. Employing a development-sensitive, individualised approach, we reliably identify an inherent, development-specific fast sleep spindle type, though nested in the adult-like slow sleep spindle frequency range, along with a dominant slow sleep spindle type. Further, we provide evidence for the modulation of fast sleep spindles during slow oscillations, already in pre-school children. However, the temporal coordination between fast sleep spindles and slow oscillations is weaker and less precise than expected from adult research. While we do not find evidence for a critical contribution of the pattern of fast sleep spindle modulation during slow oscillations for memory consolidation, crucially, both inherent slow and fast sleep spindles separately are differentially related to sleep-associated consolidation of items of varying quality. While a higher number of slow sleep spindles is associated with stronger maintenance of medium-quality memories, more fast sleep spindles are linked to higher gain of low-quality items. Our results provide evidence for two functionally relevant inherent sleep spindle types in pre-school children despite not fully matured sleep spindle - slow oscillation coupling.",,,,,,,,,"Joechner, Ann-Kathrin and Wehmeier, Sarah and Werkle-Bergner, Markus",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-09-07 14:33:59 +0200,2020-09-07 14:34:20 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.09.04.283606,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,sep,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Electrophysiological Indicators of Sleep-associated Memory Consolidation in 5- to 6-year-old Children,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101%2F2020.09.04.283606,,2020,

Examination of neural representations of space at fast time scales revealed a transient but repeatable phenomenon as rats made a decision: the location reconstructed from the neural ensemble swept forward, first down one path and then the other. Estimated representations were coherent and preferentially swept ahead of the animal rather than behind the animal, implying it represented future possibilities rather than recently traveled paths. Similar phenomena occurred at other important decisions (such as in recovery from an error). Local field potentials from these sites contained pronounced theta and gamma frequencies, but no sharp wave frequencies.

phdthesis,Johnson2008UM,"Cognitive maps were proposed as an alternative to stimulus-response explanations of animal behavior. Although the concept of cognitive maps advanced treatments of complex animal behavior, it has remained resistant to theoretical definition. A simplified perspective on cognitive maps that focused on spatial behavior and the construction of spatial maps has provided an important approach to understanding the role of the hippocampus in spatial behavior and spatially modulated neural activity, particularly within the hippocampus. However, this perspective leaves open many questions on how spatial maps and neural activities within the hippocampus are used and how they contribute to selection of adaptive actions. A reinforcement learning approach to animal behavior was used to develop a theory of cognitive map function. Reinforcement learning provides a theoretical framework within which the components of cognitive map function can be readily defined and explored. This approach addresses long-standing criticisms of cognitive map theory by explicit mapping of stimuli to action via specific, albeit behaviorally unobservable, computations. Flexible behavior associated with cognitive maps implies the use of transition models in reinforcement learning algorithms. In contrast to model-free algorithms that depend on current experience only, model-based reinforcement algorithms represent sensory or state information beyond the modeled animal's current sensory experience. As a result, model-based reinforcement learning provides a principled approach to analysis of neural representations and the dynamic processes that support cognition. Neurophysiological recordings in the hippocampus showed that apparent noise present in spatially modulated place cell activity could be explained as coherent spatial representations that deviated from the animal's position on the maze. These non-local representations were associated with fast spatial representation dynamics and were typically found when the animal was at feeder locations or choice points. Non-local representations at choice points shifted forward of the animal to potential future spatial positions and were associated with theta and gamma local field potential activity. Forward-shifted spatial representations were associated with vicarious-trial-and-error behaviors and were task and experience dependent. In sum, these results suggest how cognitive maps in the hippocampus can contribute to selection of adaptive actions through the construction of past events and potential future experiences.",,,,,,,,,"Johnson, Adam Conrad",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 10:24:48 +0100,2020-10-27 10:26:03 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota,,,,,On the use of cognitive maps,,,,,,,2008,

We test the plausibility of this hypothesis in a computational model of a multiple-T choice-task. Rats show two learning rates on this task: a fast decrease in errors and a slow development of a stereotyped path.

By examining these processes, we show how information directed information foraging provides a formal theoretical explanation for the common hippocampal substrates of constructive memory, vicarious trial and error behavior, schema-based facilitation of memory performance, and memory consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Johnson, Adam and Varberg, Zachary and Benhardus, James and Maahs, Anthony and Schrater, Paul",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-20 10:51:53 +0100,2021-01-20 10:52:17 +0100,,,10.3389/fnhum.2012.00216,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5161,,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,216,,,,,,,,,,,,The hippocampus and exploration: dynamically evolving behavior and neural representations,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00216,6,2012,
article,Johnson2007CON,"Learning and memory and navigation literatures emphasize interactions between multiple memory systems: a flexible, planning-based system and a rigid, cached-value system. This has profound implications for decision-making. Recent conceptualizations of flexible decision-making employ prospection and projection arising from a network involving the hippocampus. Recent recordings from rodent hippocampus in decision-making situations have found transient forward-shifted representations. Evaluation of that prediction and subsequent action-selection probably occurs downstream (e.g. in orbitofrontal cortex, in ventral and dorsomedial striatum). Classically, striatum has been identified as a crucial component of the less-flexible, incremental system.

article,Jones2012S,"There is an ongoing debate over what the orbitofrontal cortex contributes to behavior, learning, and decision-making. Jones et al. (p. 953) found that the orbitofrontal cortex was important for value-based computations when value must be inferred from an associative model of the task but not when value estimates based on previous experience are sufficient. This result calls into question the assumption that this region simply signals economic value. However, it would be consistent with a concept of the orbitofrontal cortex as being important for constructing model-based representations of the world that are orthogonal to value.Computational and learning theory models propose that behavioral control reflects value that is both cached (computed and stored during previous experience) and inferred (estimated on the fly on the basis of knowledge of the causal structure of the environment). The latter is thought to depend on the orbitofrontal cortex. Yet some accounts propose that the orbitofrontal cortex contributes to behavior by signaling {\textquotedblleft}economic{\textquotedblright} value, regardless of the associative basis of the information. We found that the orbitofrontal cortex is critical for both value-based behavior and learning when value must be inferred but not when a cached value is sufficient.

article,Jones2005PB,"Decision-making requires the coordinated activity of diverse brain structures. For example, in maze-based tasks, the prefrontal cortex must integrate spatial information encoded in the hippocampus with mnemonic information concerning route and task rules in order to direct behavior appropriately. Using simultaneous tetrode recordings from CA1 of the rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, we show that correlated firing in the two structures is selectively enhanced during behavior that recruits spatial working memory, allowing the integration of hippocampal spatial information into a broader, decision-making network. The increased correlations are paralleled by enhanced coupling of the two structures in the 4- to 12-Hz theta-frequency range. Thus the coordination of theta rhythms may constitute a general mechanism through which the relative timing of disparate neural activities can be controlled, allowing specialized brain structures to both encode information independently and to interact selectively according to current behavioral demands.",,,,,,,,,"Jones, Matthew W and Wilson, Matthew A",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-18 14:07:48 +0100,2020-12-18 14:08:25 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pbio.0030402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS Biology,,,,,,,,,,,11,,,12,,,,,,,Public Library of Science,,,,,,,,Theta Rhythms Coordinate Hippocampal--Prefrontal Interactions in a Spatial Memory Task,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030402,3,2005,
article,Jonker2018PNAS,"Remembering is a complex process that involves recalling specific details, such as who you were with when you celebrated your last birthday, as well as contextual information, such as the place where you celebrated. It is well established that the act of remembering enhances long-term retention of the retrieved information, but the neural and cognitive mechanisms that drive memory enhancement are not yet understood. One possibility is that the process of remembering results in reactivation of the broader episodic context. Consistent with this idea, in two experiments, we found that multiple retrieval attempts enhanced long-term retention of both the retrieved object and the nontarget object that shared scene context, compared with a restudy control. Using representational similarity analysis of fMRI data in experiment 2, we found that retrieval resulted in greater neural reactivation of both the target objects and contextually linked objects compared with restudy. Furthermore, this reactivation occurred in a network of medial and lateral parietal lobe regions that have been linked to episodic recollection. The results demonstrate that retrieving a memory can enhance retention of information that is linked in the broader event context and the hippocampus and a posterior medial network of parietal cortical areas (also known as the Default Network) play complementary roles in supporting the reactivation of episodically linked information during retrieval.",,,,,,,,,"Jonker, Tanya R. and Dimsdale-Zucker, Halle and Ritchey, Maureen and Clarke, Alex and Ranganath, Charan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 10:20:56 +0200,2020-05-11 10:22:04 +0200,,,10.1073/pnas.1800006115,,,,,,,,,,,,1091-6490,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,43,,,11084--11089,,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Neural reactivation in parietal cortex enhances memory for episodically linked information,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800006115,115,2018,
article,Jonschkowski2015AR,"Robot learning is critically enabled by the availability of appropriate state representations. We propose a robotics-specific approach to learning such state representations. As robots accomplish tasks by interacting with the physical world, we can facilitate representation learning by considering the structure imposed by physics; this structure is reflected in the changes that occur in the world and in the way a robot can effect them. By exploiting this structure in learning, robots can obtain state representations consistent with the aspects of physics relevant to the learning task. We name this prior knowledge about the structure of interactions with the physical world robotic priors. We identify five robotic priors and explain how they can be used to learn pertinent state representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated and real robotic experiments with distracting moving objects. We show that our method extracts task-relevant state representations from high-dimensional observations, even in the presence of task-irrelevant distractions.

article,Joo2018NRN,"Various cognitive functions have long been known to require the hippocampus. Recently, progress has been made in identifying the hippocampal neural activity patterns that implement these functions. One such pattern is the sharp wave--ripple (SWR), an event associated with highly synchronous neural firing in the hippocampus and modulation of neural activity in distributed brain regions. Hippocampal spiking during SWRs can represent past or potential future experience, and SWR-related interventions can alter subsequent memory performance. These findings and others suggest that SWRs support both memory consolidation and memory retrieval for processes such as decision-making. In addition, studies have identified distinct types of SWR based on representational content, behavioural state and physiological features. These various findings regarding SWRs suggest that different SWR types correspond to different cognitive functions, such as retrieval and consolidation. Here, we introduce another possibility --- that a single SWR may support more than one cognitive function. Taking into account classic psychological theories and recent molecular results that suggest that retrieval and consolidation share mechanisms, we propose that the SWR mediates the retrieval of stored representations that can be utilized immediately by downstream circuits in decision-making, planning, recollection and/or imagination while simultaneously initiating memory consolidation processes.",,,,,,,,,"Joo, Hannah R. and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 19:05:42 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/s41583-018-0077-1,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-0048,,,Nature Reviews Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,12,,,744--757,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,"replay, review",,The hippocampal sharp wave--ripple in memory retrieval for immediate use and consolidation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41583-018-0077-1,19,2018,

Here, we show that LC activation reliably anticipates changes in pupil diameter that either fluctuate naturally or are driven by external events during near fixation, as in many psychophysical tasks. This relationship occurs on as fine a temporal and spatial scale as single spikes from single units. However, this relationship is not specific to the LC. Similar relationships, albeit with delayed timing and different reliabilities across sites, are evident in the inferior and superior colliculus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex.

article,Josselyn2020S,"In 1904, Richard Semon introduced the term ``engram'' to describe the neural substrate for storing memories. An experience, Semon proposed, activates a subset of cells that undergo off-line, persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram. Subsequent reactivation of this engram induces memory retrieval.

article,Ju2020NN,"A group of neurons can generate patterns of activity that represent information about stimuli; subsequently, the group can transform and transmit activity patterns across synapses to spatially distributed areas. Recent studies in neuroscience have begun to independently address the two components of information processing: the representation of stimuli in neural activity and the transmission of information in networks that model neural interactions. Yet only recently are studies seeking to link these two types of approaches. Here we briefly review the two separate bodies of literature; we then review the recent strides made to address this gap. We continue with a discussion of how patterns of activity evolve from one representation to another, forming dynamic representations that unfold on the underlying network.

article,Juechems2021PNAS,"When making economic decisions, humans can evaluate probabilities and magnitudes of outcomes in an idiosyncratic way that can lead to poor decisions. This suggests that the internal functions that map objective quantities onto subjective utilities are nonlinear. Here, we ask why utility functions take this form, making the assumption that human decisions are intrinsically variable (corrupted by noise). Using simulations, we show that the canonical nonlinear form of these functions maximizes reward and minimizes uncertainty for a noisy decision agent. We demonstrate in two experiments that humans adapt optimally to manipulations of outcome certainty. Thus, our results suggest that observed subjective functions may represent an optimal adaptation within the constraints imposed by biology.When making economic choices, such as those between goods or gambles, humans act as if their internal representation of the value and probability of a prospect is distorted away from its true value. These distortions give rise to decisions which apparently fail to maximize reward, and preferences that reverse without reason. Why would humans have evolved to encode value and probability in a distorted fashion, in the face of selective pressure for reward-maximizing choices? Here, we show that under the simple assumption that humans make decisions with finite computational precision{\textendash}{\textendash}in other words, that decisions are irreducibly corrupted by noise{\textendash}{\textendash}the distortions of value and probability displayed by humans are approximately optimal in that they maximize reward and minimize uncertainty. In two empirical studies, we manipulate factors that change the reward-maximizing form of distortion, and find that in each case, humans adapt optimally to the manipulation. This work suggests an answer to the longstanding question of why humans make {\textquotedblleft}irrational{\textquotedblright} economic choices.All data, and code to reproduce all figures and to run the simulations, are freely available on our laboratory GitHub repository at https://github.com/keno-juchems/PT_optimality.",,,,,,,,,"Juechems, Keno and Balaguer, Jan and Spitzer, Bernhard and Summerfield, Christopher",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-21 10:27:19 +0100,2021-01-21 10:27:38 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.2002232118,,,,,e2002232118,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2002232118.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Optimal utility and probability functions for agents with finite computational precision,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2002232118,118,2021,

article,Jun2020N,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer from spatial memory impairment and wandering behavior, but the brain circuit mechanisms causing such symptoms remain largely unclear. In healthy brains, spatially tuned hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells exhibit distinct spike patterns in different environments, a circuit function called ``remapping.'' We tested remapping in amyloid precursor protein knockin (APP-KI) mice with impaired spatial memory. CA1 neurons, including place cells, showed disrupted remapping, although their spatial tuning was only mildly diminished. Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons severely lost their spatial tuning and grid cells were almost absent. Fast gamma oscillatory coupling between the MEC and CA1 was also impaired. Mild disruption of MEC grid cells emerged in younger APP-KI mice, although the spatial memory and CA1 remapping of the animals remained intact. These results point to remapping impairment in the hippocampus, possibly linked to grid cell disruption, as circuit mechanisms underlying spatial memory impairment in AD.

article,Jung1994JN,"The septal and temporal poles of the hippocampus differ markedly in their anatomical and neurochemical organization. Although it is well established that the internal representation of space is a fundamental function of hippocampal neurons, most of what is known about spatial coding in the hippocampus of freely moving animals has come from recordings from the dorsal one-third (largely for technical convenience). The present study therefore compared the spatial selectivity of CA1 neurons in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of rats during performance of a food reinforced, random search task in a square chamber containing simple visual landmarks. Neural activity was recorded in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of opposite hemispheres in the same rats, in many cases simultaneously. As in dorsal hippocampus, ventral CA1 units could be classified as {\textquotedblleft}complex spike{\textquotedblright} (pyramidal) cells or {\textquotedblleft}theta{\textquotedblright} interneurons. Both dorsal and ventral theta cells fired at relatively high rates and with low spatial selectivity in the apparatus. Of the population of complex spike cells in the ventral hippocampus, a significantly smaller number had {\textquotedblleft}place fields{\textquotedblright} than in the dorsal hippocampus, and the average spatial selectivity was of significantly lower resolution than that found among dorsal hippocampal complex spike cells. Thus, a septotemporal difference of spatial selectivity was found in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampus, complementing many other anatomical and neuropharmacological studies. A number of possible functional interpretations can be suggested from these results, including a computational advantage of representing space at different scales or a preeminence of essentially nonspatial information processing in the ventral hippocampus.",,,,,,,,,"Jung, MW and Wiener, SI and McNaughton, BL",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 11:20:51 +0100,2021-01-27 11:21:18 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.14-12-07347.1994,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/12/7347.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,7347--7356,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Comparison of spatial firing characteristics of units in dorsal and ventral hippocampus of the rat,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/12/7347,14,1994,
article,Kaefer2019H,"Aberrant proteostasis of protein aggregation may lead to behavior disorders including chronic mental illnesses (CMI). Furthermore, the neuronal activity alterations that underlie CMI are not well understood. We recorded the local field potential and single‐unit activity of the hippocampal CA1 region in vivo in rats transgenically overexpressing the Disrupted‐in‐Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene (tgDISC1), modeling sporadic CMI. These tgDISC1 rats have previously been shown to exhibit DISC1 protein aggregation, disturbances in the dopaminergic system and attention‐related deficits. Recordings were performed during exploration of familiar and novel open field environments and during sleep, allowing investigation of neuronal abnormalities in unconstrained behavior. Compared to controls, tgDISC1 place cells exhibited smaller place fields and decreased speed‐modulation of their firing rates, demonstrating altered spatial coding and deficits in encoding location‐independent sensory inputs. Oscillation analyses showed that tgDISC1 pyramidal neurons had higher theta phase locking strength during novelty, limiting their phase coding ability. However, their mean theta phases were more variable at the population level, reducing oscillatory network synchronization. Finally, tgDISC1 pyramidal neurons showed a lack of novelty‐induced shift in their preferred theta and gamma firing phases, indicating deficits in coding of novel environments with oscillatory firing. By combining single cell and neuronal population analyses, we link DISC1 protein pathology with abnormal hippocampal neural coding and network synchrony, and thereby gain a more comprehensive understanding of CMI mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,"Kaefer, Karola and Malagon-Vina, Hugo and Dickerson, Desiree D. and O{\textquotesingle}Neill, Joseph and Trossbach, Svenja V. and Korth, Carsten and Csicsvari, Jozsef",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-09-10 15:32:34 +0200,2020-12-30 17:34:45 +0100,,,10.1002/hipo.23076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,feb,,,,,,,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 overexpression disrupts hippocampal coding and oscillatory synchronization,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hipo.23076,,2019,

While replay of trajectories is well established for the hippocampus, it is unclear whether the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can reactivate sequential behavioral experiences in the awake state to support task execution. We simultaneously recorded from hippocampal and mPFC principal neurons in rats performing a mPFC-dependent rule-switching task on a plus maze. We found that mPFC neuronal activity encoded relative positions between the start and goal. During awake immobility periods, the mPFC replayed temporally organized sequences of these generalized positions, resembling entire spatial trajectories. The occurrence of mPFC trajectory replay positively correlated with rule-switching performance. However, hippocampal and mPFC trajectory replay occurred independently, indicating different functions.

Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.

article,Kahn2018NHB,"Human learners are adept at grasping the complex relationships underlying incoming sequential input1. In the present work, we formalize complex relationships as graph structures2 derived from temporal associations3,4 in motor sequences. Next, we explore the extent to which learners are sensitive to key variations in the topological properties5 inherent to those graph structures. Participants performed a probabilistic motor sequence task in which the order of button presses was determined by the traversal of graphs with modular, lattice-like or random organization. Graph nodes each represented a unique button press, and edges represented a transition between button presses. The results indicate that learning, indexed here by participants' response times, was strongly mediated by the graph's mesoscale organization, with modular graphs being associated with shorter response times than random and lattice graphs. Moreover, variations in a node's number of connections (degree) and a node's role in mediating long-distance communication (betweenness centrality) impacted graph learning, even after accounting for the level of practice on that node. These results demonstrate that the graph architecture underlying temporal sequences of stimuli fundamentally constrains learning, and moreover that tools from network science provide a valuable framework for assessing how learners encode complex, temporally structured information.",,,,,,,,,"Kahn, Ari E. and Karuza, Elisabeth A. and Vettel, Jean M. and Bassett, Danielle S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-04 12:13:43 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/s41562-018-0463-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2397-3374,,,Nature Human Behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,12,,,936--947,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,koenigsberg,,Network constraints on learnability of probabilistic motor sequences,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0463-8,2,2018,
article,Kahnt2012JN,"Optimal choices benefit from previous learning. However, it is not clear how previously learned stimuli influence behavior to novel but similar stimuli. One possibility is to generalize based on the similarity between learned and current stimuli. Here, we use neuroscientific methods and a novel computational model to inform the question of how stimulus generalization is implemented in the human brain. Behavioral responses during an intradimensional discrimination task showed similarity-dependent generalization. Moreover, a peak shift occurred, i.e., the peak of the behavioral generalization gradient was displaced from the rewarded conditioned stimulus in the direction away from the unrewarded conditioned stimulus. To account for the behavioral responses, we designed a similarity-based reinforcement learning model wherein prediction errors generalize across similar stimuli and update their value. We show that this model predicts a similarity-dependent neural generalization gradient in the striatum as well as changes in responding during extinction. Moreover, across subjects, the width of generalization was negatively correlated with functional connectivity between the striatum and the hippocampus. This result suggests that hippocampus{\textendash}striatal connections contribute to stimulus-specific value updating by controlling the width of generalization. In summary, our results shed light onto the neurobiology of a fundamental, similarity-dependent learning principle that allows learning the value of stimuli that have never been encountered.",,,,,,,,,"Kahnt, Thorsten and Park, Soyoung Q and Burke, Christopher J. and Tobler, Philippe N.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 16:55:24 +0100,2021-01-18 16:55:39 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2383-12.2012,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/46/16521.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46,,,16521--16529,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,How Glitter Relates to Gold: Similarity-Dependent Reward Prediction Errors in the Human Striatum,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/46/16521,32,2012,

We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception.

article,Kang2019E,"Grid cells fire in sequences that represent rapid trajectories in space. During locomotion, theta sequences encode sweeps in position starting slightly behind the animal and ending ahead of it. During quiescence and slow wave sleep, bouts of synchronized activity represent long trajectories called replays, which are well-established in place cells and have been recently reported in grid cells. Theta sequences and replay are hypothesized to facilitate many cognitive functions, but their underlying mechanisms are unknown. One mechanism proposed for grid cell formation is the continuous attractor network. We demonstrate that this established architecture naturally produces theta sequences and replay as distinct consequences of modulating external input. Driving inhibitory interneurons at the theta frequency causes attractor bumps to oscillate in speed and size, which gives rise to theta sequences and phase precession, respectively. Decreasing input drive to all neurons produces traveling wavefronts of activity that are decoded as replays.",,,,,,,,journal,"Kang, Louis and DeWeese, Michael R",,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,,,,,,,eLife 2019;8:e46351,,,,2020-12-18 14:52:51 +0100,2020-12-18 14:53:09 +0100,,,10.7554/eLife.46351,,,"Deshmukh, Sachin and Colgin, Laura L and Deshmukh, Sachin and Blair, Tad",,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,"grid cell, replay, phase precession, theta sequence, continuous attractor, wavefront",,,,,,,,nov,,,,,,e46351,,,2019-11-18,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,Replay as wavefronts and theta sequences as bump oscillations in a grid cell attractor network,,,,,https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.46351,8,2019,

article,Kaplan2016CB,"The default mode network (DMN) is a commonly observed resting-state network (RSN) that includes medial temporal, parietal, and prefrontal regions involved in episodic memory [1, 2, 3]. The behavioral relevance of endogenous DMN activity remains elusive, despite an emerging literature correlating resting fMRI fluctuations with memory performance [4, 5]---particularly in DMN regions [6, 7, 8]. Mechanistic support for the DMN's role in memory consolidation might come from investigation of large deflections (sharp-waves) in the hippocampal local field potential that co-occur with high-frequency (>80 Hz) oscillations called ripples---both during sleep [9, 10] and awake deliberative periods [11, 12, 13]. Ripples are ideally suited for memory consolidation [14, 15], since the reactivation of hippocampal place cell ensembles occurs during ripples [16, 17, 18, 19]. Moreover, the number of ripples after learning predicts subsequent memory performance in rodents [20, 21, 22] and humans [23], whereas electrical stimulation of the hippocampus after learning interferes with memory consolidation [24, 25, 26]. A recent study in macaques showed diffuse fMRI neocortical activation and subcortical deactivation specifically after ripples [27]. Yet it is unclear whether ripples and other hippocampal neural events influence endogenous fluctuations in specific RSNs---like the DMN---unitarily. Here, we examine fMRI datasets from anesthetized monkeys with simultaneous hippocampal electrophysiology recordings, where we observe a dramatic increase in the DMN fMRI signal following ripples, but not following other hippocampal electrophysiological events. Crucially, we find increases in ongoing DMN activity after ripples, but not in other RSNs. Our results relate endogenous DMN fluctuations to hippocampal ripples, thereby linking network-level resting fMRI fluctuations with behaviorally relevant circuit-level neural dynamics.",,,,,,,,,"Kaplan, Raphael and Adhikari, Mohit H. and Hindriks, Rikkert and Mantini, Dante and Murayama, Yusuke and Logothetis, Nikos K. and Deco, Gustavo",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-21 17:31:51 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2016.01.017,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,5,,,686--691,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripples Influence Selective Activation of the Default Mode Network,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.01.017,26,2016,

This raises the possibility that increases in human hippocampal theta power accompany the evaluation of upcoming spatial choices. To test this hypothesis, we measured neural oscillations during a spatial planning task that closely resembles a perceptual decision-making paradigm. In this task, participants searched visually for the shortest path between a start and goal location in novel mazes that contained multiple choice points, and were subsequently asked to make a spatial decision at one of those choice points. We observed ~4--8 Hz hippocampal/medial temporal lobe theta power increases specific to sequential planning that were negatively correlated with subsequent decision speed, where decision speed was inversely correlated with choice accuracy. These results implicate the hippocampal theta rhythm in decision tree search during planning in novel environments.

article,Karimi-Abadchi2020E,"A prevalent model is that sharp-wave ripples (SWR) arise 'spontaneously' in CA3 and propagate recent memory traces outward to the neocortex to facilitate memory consolidation there. Using voltage and extracellular glutamate transient recording over widespread regions of mice dorsal neocortex in relation to CA1 multiunit activity (MUA) and SWR, we find that the largest SWR-related modulation occurs in retrosplenial cortex; however, contrary to the unidirectional hypothesis, neocortical activation exhibited a continuum of activation timings relative to SWRs, varying from leading to lagging. Thus, contrary to the model in which SWRs arise 'spontaneously' in the hippocampus, neocortical activation often precedes SWRs and may thus constitute a trigger event in which neocortical information seeds associative reactivation of hippocampal 'indices'. This timing continuum is consistent with a dynamics in which older, more consolidated memories may in fact initiate the hippocampal-neocortical dialog, whereas reactivation of newer memories may be initiated predominantly in the hippocampus.",,,,,,,,,"Karimi Abadchi, Javad and Nazari-Ahangarkolaee, Mojtaba and Gattas, Sandra and Bermudez-Contreras, Edgar and Luczak, Artur and McNaughton, Bruce L and Mohajerani, Majid H",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-24 10:51:10 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.7554/elife.51972,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,ripples,,Spatiotemporal patterns of neocortical activity around hippocampal sharp-wave ripples,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.51972,9,2020,

Replay is present during both sleep and waking behavior, but although sleep replay involves the reactivation of stored representations in the absence of specific sensory inputs, awake replay is thought to depend on sensory input from the current environment. Here, we show that stored representations are reactivated during both waking and sleep replay. We found frequent awake replay of sequences of rat hippocampal place cells from a previous experience. This spatially remote replay was as common as local replay of the current environment and was more robust when the rat had recently been in motion than during extended periods of quiescence.

article,Karlsson2008JN,"During development, activity-dependent processes increase the specificity of neural responses to stimuli, but the role that this type of process plays in adult plasticity is unclear. We examined the dynamics of hippocampal activity as animals learned about new environments to understand how neural selectivity changes with experience. Hippocampal principal neurons fire when the animal is located in a particular subregion of its environment, and in any given environment the hippocampal representation is sparse: less than half of the neurons in areas CA1 and CA3 are active whereas the rest are essentially silent. Here we show that different dynamics govern the evolution of this sparsity in CA1 and upstream area CA3. CA1, but not CA3, produces twice as many spikes in novel compared with familiar environments. This high rate firing continues during sharp wave ripple events in a subsequent rest period. The overall CA1 population rate declines and the number of active cells decreases as the environment becomes familiar and task performance improves, but the decline in rate is not uniform across neurons. Instead, the activity of cells with initial peak spatial rates above \~{}12 Hz is enhanced, whereas the activity of cells with lower initial peak rates is suppressed. The result of these changes is that the active CA1 population comes to consist of a relatively small group of cells with strong spatial tuning. This process is not evident in CA3, indicating that a region-specific and long timescale process operates in CA1 to create a sparse, spatially informative population of neurons.",,,,,,,,,"Karlsson, Mattias P. and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 13:49:45 +0100,2020-12-14 13:50:05 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4261-08.2008,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/52/14271.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52,,,14271--14281,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,"Network Dynamics Underlying the Formation of Sparse, Informative Representations in the Hippocampus",,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/52/14271,28,2008,

How human learners exploit this information remains an essential question. Here, we focus on the temporal constraints that govern such a process. Participants viewed a continuous sequence of images generated by three distinct walks on a modular network. Walks varied along two critical dimensions: their predictability and the density with which they sampled from communities of images. Learners exposed to walks that richly sampled from each community exhibited a sharp increase in processing time upon entry into a new community.

article,Kay2019aB,"Most functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is conducted with gradient-echo pulse sequences. Although this yields high sensitivity to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals, gradient-echo acquisitions are heavily influenced by venous effects which limit the ultimate spatial resolution and spatial accuracy of fMRI. While alternative acquisition methods such as spin-echo can be used to mitigate venous effects, these methods lead to serious reductions in signal-to-noise ratio and spatial coverage, and are difficult to implement without leakage of undesirable non-spin-echo effects into the data. Moreover, analysis heuristics such as masking veins or sampling inner cortical depths using high-resolution fMRI may be helpful, but sacrifice information from many parts of the brain. Here, we describe a new analysis method that is compatible with conventional gradient-echo acquisition and provides venous-free response estimates throughout the entire imaged volume. The method involves fitting a low-dimensional manifold characterizing variation in response timecourses observed in a given dataset, and then using identified early and late timecourses as basis functions for decomposing responses into components related to the microvasculature (capillaries and small venules) and the macrovasculature (veins), respectively. We show that this Temporal Decomposition through Manifold Fitting (TDM) method is robust, consistently deriving meaningful timecourses in individual fMRI scan sessions. Moreover, we show that by removing late components, TDM substantially reduces the superficial cortical depth bias present in gradient-echo BOLD responses and eliminates artifacts in cortical activity maps. TDM is general: it can be applied to any task-based fMRI experiment, can be used with standard- or high-resolution fMRI acquisitions, and can even be used to remove residual venous effects from specialized acquisition methods like spin-echo. We suggest that TDM is a powerful method that improves the spatial accuracy of fMRI and provides insight into the origins of the BOLD signal.",,,,,,,,,"Kay, Kendrick and Jamison, Keith W. and Zhang, Ruyuan and Ugurbil, Kamil",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-15 10:10:01 +0200,2020-07-15 10:10:58 +0200,,,10.1101/868455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,TDM: a temporal decomposition method for removing venous effects from task-based fMRI,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/868455,,2019,

article,Kay2019H,"Contemporary brain research seeks to understand how cognition is reducible to neural activity. Crucially, much of this effort is guided by a scientific paradigm that views neural activity as essentially driven by external stimuli. In contrast, recent perspectives argue that this paradigm is by itself inadequate and that understanding patterns of activity intrinsic to the brain is needed to explain cognition. Yet, despite this critique, the stimulus-driven paradigm still dominates-possibly because a convincing alternative has not been clear. Here, we review a series of findings suggesting such an alternative. These findings indicate that neural activity in the hippocampus occurs in one of three brain states that have radically different anatomical, physiological, representational, and behavioral correlates, together implying different functional roles in cognition. This three-state framework also indicates that neural representations in the hippocampus follow a surprising pattern of organization at the timescale of ∼1 s or longer. Lastly, beyond the hippocampus, recent breakthroughs indicate three parallel states in the cortex, suggesting shared principles and brain-wide organization of intrinsic neural activity.","Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience, Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience, Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.",,,,,,,,"Kay, Kenneth and Frank, Loren M",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 14:22:50 +0100,2020-12-22 11:01:45 +0100,,,10.1002/hipo.22956,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,brain state; cortex; hippocampus; imagination; memory; naturalistic behavior; prospection; sharp wave-ripple,,,,,,,,Mar,,,3,,,184--238,,,,,,,,,,,,Three brain states in the hippocampus and cortex,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22956,29,2019,
article,Kemere2013P,"Hippocampal information processing is often described as two-state, with a place cell state during movement and a reactivation state during stillness. Relatively little is known about how the network transitions between these different patterns of activity during exploration. Here we show that hippocampal network changes quickly and continuously as animals explore and become familiar with initially novel places. We measured the relationship between moment-by-moment changes in behavior and information flow through hippocampal output area CA1 in rats. We examined local field potential (LFP) patterns, evoked potentials and ensemble spiking and found evidence suggestive of a smooth transition from strong CA3 drive of CA1 activity at low speeds to entorhinal cortical drive of CA1 activity at higher speeds. These changes occurred with changes in behavior on a timescale of less than a second, suggesting a continuous modulation of information processing in the hippocampal circuit as a function of behavioral state.",,,,,,,,,"Kemere, Caleb and Carr, Margaret F. and Karlsson, Mattias P. and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-15 08:40:32 +0100,2021-01-15 08:40:49 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0073114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,09,,,9,,,1-16,,,,Public Library of Science,,,,,,,,Rapid and Continuous Modulation of Hippocampal Network State during Exploration of New Places,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073114,8,2013,
article,Kennedy2004JN,"Episodic memory encodes the unique contexts of events so that people can remember the details of an experience when cued by only a subset of event features (Tulving, 1972). In humans, the hippocampus is crucial for this kind of memory (Scoville and Milner, 1957; Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997). The present study tested whether the hippocampus was required for nonspatial, context-dependent memory retrieval in rats that were trained in a constant external environment to approach different nonspatial goal objects depending on their current internal motivational state (hunger or thirst). The rats learned to reliably approach the correct goal and thus used internal context to guide associative memory retrieval. Both fornix transection and selective neurotoxic hippocampal lesions severely impaired memory performance, but cue and motivational discrimination, as well as stimulus-reward associations, were preserved. The findings suggest that the hippocampus is required for using internal contextual information for flexible associative memory retrieval.",,,,,,,,,"Kennedy, Pamela J. and Shapiro, Matthew L.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL2tlbm5lZHkyMDA0am4ucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EWtlbm5lZHkyMDA0am4ucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczprZW5uZWR5MjAwNGpuLnBkZgAOACQAEQBrAGUAbgBuAGUAZAB5ADIAMAAwADQAagBuAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2tlbm5lZHkyMDA0am4ucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-11 12:11:13 +0100,2020-12-11 12:11:33 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1388-04.2004,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6979.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31,,,6979--6985,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Retrieving Memories via Internal Context Requires the Hippocampus,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6979,24,2004,
article,Kennedy2009PNAS,"Adaptive behaviors are guided by motivation and memory. Motivational states specify goals, and memory can inform motivated behavior by providing detailed records of past experiences when goals were obtained. These 2 fundamental processes interact to guide animals to biologically relevant targets, but the neuronal mechanisms that integrate them remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we recorded unit activity from the same population of hippocampal neurons as rats performed identical tasks while either food or water deprived. We compared the influence of motivational state (hunger and thirst), memory demand, and spatial behavior in 2 tasks: hippocampus-dependent contextual memory retrieval and hippocampus-independent random foraging. We found that: (i) hippocampal coding was most strongly influenced by motivational state during contextual memory retrieval, when motivational cues were required to select among remembered, goal-directed actions in the same places; (ii) the same neuronal populations were relatively unaffected by motivational state during random foraging, when hunger and thirst were incidental to behavior, and signals derived from deprivation states thus informed, but did not determine, hippocampal coding; and (iii) {\textquotedblleft}prospective coding{\textquotedblright} in the contextual retrieval task was not influenced by allocentric spatial trajectory, but rather by the animal{\textquoteright}s deprivation state and the associated, non-spatial target, suggesting that hippocampal coding includes a wide range of predictive associations.

article,Kennedy2018SEJ,"Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is widely used to collect affordable and high-quality survey responses. However, researchers recently noticed a substantial decline in data quality, sending shockwaves throughout the social sciences. The problem seems to stem from the use of Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) by respondents outside the U.S. to fool MTurk's filtering system, but we know relatively little about the cause and consequence of this form of fraud. Analyzing 38 studies conducted on MTurk, we demonstrate that this problem is not new - we find a similar spike in VPS use in 2015. Utilizing two new studies, we show that data from these respondents is of substantially worse quality. Next, we provide two solutions for this problem using an API for an IP traceback application (IP Hub). We provide both a post-hoc method for identifying fraudulent respondents using an original R package (``rIP'') and an associated online application, and an a priori method using JavaScript and PHP code in Qualtrics to block fraudulent respondents from participating. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening procedure in a third study. Overall, our results suggest that fraudulent respondents pose a serious threat to data quality but can be easily identified and screened out.

article,Kenward1997B,"Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.",,,,,,,,,"Kenward, Michael G. and Roger, James H.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-24 10:34:58 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.2307/2533558,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-341X,,,Biometrics,,,,,,,,,,,Sep,,,3,,,983--997,9333350,,,,,,,,,,,{Small sample inference for fixed effects from restricted maximum likelihood},,,,,,53,1997,

article,Khamassi2020BC,"Hippocampal offline reactivations during reward-based learning, usually categorized as replay events, have been found to be important for performance improvement over time and for memory consolidation. Recent computational work has linked these phenomena to the need to transform reward information into state-action values for decision making and to propagate it to all relevant states of the environment. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether an integrated reinforcement learning mechanism could account for the variety of awake hippocampal reactivations, including variety in order (forward and reverse reactivated trajectories) and variety in the location where they occur (reward site or decision-point). Here, we present a model-based bidirectional search model which accounts for a variety of hippocampal reactivations. The model combines forward trajectory sampling from current position and backward sampling through prioritized sweeping from states associated with large reward prediction errors until the two trajectories connect. This is repeated until stabilization of state-action values (convergence), which could explain why hippocampal reactivations drastically diminish when the animal's performance stabilizes. Simulations in a multiple T-maze task show that forward reactivations are prominently found at decision-points while backward reactivations are exclusively generated at reward sites. Finally, the model can generate imaginary trajectories that are not allowed to the agent during task performance. We raise some experimental predictions and implications for future studies of the role of the hippocampo--prefronto--striatal network in learning.",,,,,,,,,"Khamassi, Mehdi and Girard, Beno{\^\i}t",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-24 10:36:59 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1007/s00422-020-00817-x,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-0770,,,Biological Cybernetics,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,replay; modeling,,Modeling awake hippocampal reactivations with model-based bidirectional search,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00422-020-00817-x,,2020,
article,Khamassi2012FBN,"Behavior in spatial navigation is often organized into map-based (place-driven) vs. map-free (cue-driven) strategies; behavior in operant conditioning research is often organized into goal-directed vs. habitual strategies. Here we attempt to unify the two. We review one powerful theory for distinct forms of learning during instrumental conditioning, namely model-based (maintaining a representation of the world) and model-free (reacting to immediate stimuli) learning algorithms. We extend these lines of argument to propose an alternative taxonomy for spatial navigation, showing how various previously identified strategies can be distinguished as ``model-based'' or ``model-free'' depending on the usage of information and not on the type of information (e.g., cue vs. place). We argue that identifying ``model-free'' learning with dorsolateral striatum and ``model-based'' learning with dorsomedial striatum could reconcile numerous conflicting results in the spatial navigation literature. From this perspective, we further propose that the ventral striatum plays key roles in the model-building process. We propose that the core of the ventral striatum is positioned to learn the probability of action selection for every transition between states of the world. We further review suggestions that the ventral striatal core and shell are positioned to act as ``critics'' contributing to the computation of a reward prediction error for model-free and model-based systems, respectively.",,,,,,,,,"Khamassi, Mehdi and Humphries, Mark D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-24 11:00:06 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00079,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,,,Integrating cortico-limbic-basal ganglia architectures for learning model-based and model-free navigation strategies,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00079,6,2012,

Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural oscillations in a task that simulated approach--avoidance conflict, wherein 23 male and female human participants collected monetary tokens under a threat of virtual predation. Probability of threat was signaled by color and learned beforehand by direct experience. Magnitude of threat corresponded to a possible monetary loss, signaled as a quantity. We focused our analyses on an a priori defined region-of-interest, the bilateral hippocampus. Oscillatory power under conflict was linearly predicted by threat probability in a location consistent with right mid-hippocampus. This pattern was specific to the hippocampus, most pronounced in the gamma band, and not explained by spatial movement or anxiety-like behavior. Gamma power was modulated by slower theta rhythms, and this theta modulation increased with threat probability. Furthermore, theta oscillations in the same location showed greater synchrony with mPFC theta with increased threat probability. Strikingly, these findings were not seen in relation to an increase in threat magnitude, which was explicitly signaled as a quantity and induced similar behavioral responses as learned threat probability. Thus, our findings suggest that the expression of hippocampal and mPFC oscillatory activity in the context of anxiety is specifically linked to threat memory. These findings resonate with neurocomputational accounts of the role played by hippocampal oscillations in memory.",,,,,,,,,"Khemka, Saurabh and Barnes, Gareth and Dolan, Raymond J. and Bach, Dominik R.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-07 11:02:53 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.1834-16.2017,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,29,,,6869--6876,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,replay; hippocampus; disorders,,Dissecting the Function of Hippocampal Oscillations in a Human Anxiety Model,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1834-16.2017,37,2017,

We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, concurrent with hippocampal ripples.

article,Kim2012JN,"Stress is a biologically ubiquitous factor that, when perceived uncontrollable by humans and animals, can have lingering adverse effects on brain and cognitive functions. We have previously reported that rats that experienced inescapable-unpredictable stress subsequently exhibited decreased stability of firing rates of place cells in the CA1 hippocampus, accompanied by impairments in CA1 long-term synaptic potentiation and spatial memory consolidation. Because the elevated level of glucocorticoid hormones and the heightened amygdalar activity have been implicated in the emergence of stress effects on the hippocampus, we investigated whether administration of corticosterone and electrical stimulation of the amygdala can produce stress-like alterations on hippocampal place cells. To do so, male Long--Evans rats chronically implanted with tetrodes in the hippocampus and stimulating electrodes in the amygdala were placed on a novel arena to forage for randomly dispersed food pellets while CA1 place cells were monitored across two recording sessions. Between sessions, animals received either corticosterone injection or amygdalar stimulation. We found that amygdalar stimulation reliably evoked distress behaviors and subsequently reduced the pixel-by-pixel correlation of place maps across sessions, while corticosterone administration did not. Also, the firing rates of place cells between preamygdalar and postamygdalar stimulation recording sessions were pronouncedly different, whereas those between precorticosterone and postcorticosterone injection recording sessions were not. These results suggest that the heightened amygdalar activity, but not the elevated level of corticosterone per se, reduces the stability of spatial representation in the hippocampus by altering the firing rates of place cells in a manner similar to behavioral stress.",,,,,,,,,"Kim, E.

article,Kim2017JN,"When an item is predicted in a particular context but the prediction is violated, memory for that item is weakened (Kim et al., 2014). Here, we explore what happens when such previously mispredicted items are later reencountered. According to prior neural network simulations, this sequence of events---misprediction and subsequent restudy---should lead to differentiation of the item's neural representation from the previous context (on which the misprediction was based). Specifically, misprediction weakens connections in the representation to features shared with the previous context and restudy allows new features to be incorporated into the representation that are not shared with the previous context. This cycle of misprediction and restudy should have the net effect of moving the item's neural representation away from the neural representation of the previous context. We tested this hypothesis using human fMRI by tracking changes in item-specific BOLD activity patterns in the hippocampus, a key structure for representing memories and generating predictions. In left CA2/3/DG, we found greater neural differentiation for items that were repeatedly mispredicted and restudied compared with items from a control condition that was identical except without misprediction. We also measured prediction strength in a trial-by-trial fashion and found that greater misprediction for an item led to more differentiation, further supporting our hypothesis. Therefore, the consequences of prediction error go beyond memory weakening. If the mispredicted item is restudied, the brain adaptively differentiates its memory representation to improve the accuracy of subsequent predictions and to shield it from further weakening.",,,,,,,,,"Kim, Ghootae and Norman, Kenneth A. and Turk-Browne, Nicholas B.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 16:10:41 +0100,2020-10-26 16:42:42 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,jan,,,8,,,2022--2031,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Neural Differentiation of Incorrectly Predicted Memories,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3272-16.2017,37,2017,

However, recent studies describing slowly increasing dopamine signals have instead proposed that they represent state values and arise independent from somatic spiking activity. Here we developed experimental paradigms using virtual reality that disambiguate RPEs from values. We examined dopamine circuit activity at various stages, including somatic spiking, calcium signals at somata and axons, and striatal dopamine concentrations. Our results demonstrate that ramping dopamine signals are consistent with RPEs rather than value, and this ramping is observed at all stages examined.

Here, we tested how activity-dependent processing during sleep might differentially regulate these two processes. We specifically examined how neural reactivations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were causally linked to consolidation versus weakening of the neural correlates of neuroprosthetic skill. Strikingly, we found that slow oscillations (SOs) and delta (δ) waves have dissociable and competing roles in consolidation versus forgetting. By modulating cortical spiking linked to SOs or δ waves using closed-loop optogenetic methods, we could, respectively, weaken or strengthen consolidation and thereby bidirectionally modulate sleep-dependent performance gains. We further found that changes in the temporal coupling of spindles to SOs relative to δ waves could account for such effects.

article,Kim2020NLM,"Neurons in the temporal lobe cortex exhibit reduced responses when a stimulus or a stimulus feature is repeated. This phenomenon, termed ""repetition suppression"" is the basis for many functional imaging studies that have used Blood Oxygenation Signal Dependent (BOLD) activity differences between novel and repeated items as an index of neural selectivity in hippocampal subfields. However, it is not clear how hippocampal neural activity changes across repeated experiences with a stimulus. Here, we used direct intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings of hippocampal activity to examine whether neural activity in the human hippocampus is modulated across successive repetitions of an item. Time-frequency analyses revealed that high-frequency activity, which is thought to include gamma oscillations and possible correlates of multi-unit activity, declined monotonically across successive presentations of each item. In contrast, low-frequency oscillations in the alpha and beta bands monotonically increased across successive presentations of each object. These results provide support for the assumption that, at least under some circumstances, repetition suppression (as measured by declines in high-frequency activity) can be observed in the hippocampus, and these effects are accompanied by increases in low-frequency oscillations as well.

article,Kim1997MRM,"In fMRI, images can be collected in a very short time; therefore, high temporal resolution is possible in principle. However, the temporal resolution is limited by a blurred intrinsic hemodynamic response and a finite signal‐to‐noise ratio. To determine the upper limit of temporal resolution in a single area during repeated tasks, motor cortex activity was investigated during visually instructed finger movements. Without averaging, a sequence of four single‐finger movements with an execution time of approximately 2 s can be resolved when the delay time between consecutive sequences is at least 3 s. The hemodynamic response time is constant for each subject, but not among different subjects. The temporal resolution can be better when the signal from spatially distinct regions is examined. For a series of experiments involving a visually instructed delayed cued finger movement task with a well‐defined, independently determined, variable delay time, time courses in the motor area are distinct from each other in two experiments if the difference in delay time is as little as 2 s. The activation in the visual area due to the presentation of the task serves here as an internal time reference.

The ideal experiment to explore this issue would be to monitor changes in hippocampal neural coding throughout the entire learning process, as subjects acquire and use new episodic memories to guide behavior. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether established hippocampally-dependent learning paradigms are suitable for this kind of experiment. The goal of this study was to determine whether learning of the W-track continuous alternation task depends on the hippocampal formation. We tested six rats with NMDA lesions of the hippocampal formation and four sham-operated controls. Compared to controls, rats with hippocampal lesions made a significantly higher proportion of errors and took significantly longer to reach learning criterion. The effect of hippocampal lesion was not due to a deficit in locomotion or motivation, because rats with hippocampal lesions ran well on a linear track for food reward. Rats with hippocampal lesions also exhibited a pattern of perseverative errors during early task experience suggestive of an inability to suppress behaviors learned during pretraining on a linear track.

article,King1999JP,"The study of the physiological role of long‐term potentiation (LTP) is often hampered by the challenge of finding a physiological event that can be used to assess synaptic strength. We explored the possibility of utilising a naturally occurring event, the hippocampal sharp wave (SPW), for the assessment of synaptic strength and the induction of LTP in vivo. We used two methods in which hippocampal cells were either recorded intracellularly or extracellularly in vivo. In both cases, a linear association between the magnitude of the SPW and cellular responsiveness was observed. LTP was induced by depolarising cells during SPWs by either direct intracellular current injection or extracellular microstimulation adjacent to the cell body. Both of these approaches led to an increase in the slope of the linear association between SPWs and cellular responsiveness. This change was achieved without a rise in overall cell excitability, implying that the synapses providing input to CA1 cells during sharp waves had undergone potentiation.

article,Kinsky2018CB,"To provide a substrate for remembering where in space events have occurred, place cells must reliably encode the same positions across long timescales. However, in many cases, place cells exhibit instability by randomly reorganizing their place fields between experiences, challenging this premise. Recent evidence suggests that, in some cases, instability could also arise from coherent rotations of place fields, as well as from random reorganization. To investigate this possibility, we performed in vivo calcium imaging in dorsal hippocampal region CA1 of freely moving mice while they explored two arenas with different geometry and visual cues across 8 days. The two arenas were rotated randomly between sessions and then connected, allowing us to probe how cue rotations, the integration of new information about the environment, and the passage of time concurrently influenced the spatial coherence of place fields. We found that spatially coherent rotations of place-field maps in the same arena predominated, persisting up to 6 days later, and that they frequently rotated in a manner that did not match that of the arena rotation. Furthermore, place-field maps were flexible, as mice frequently employed a similar, coherent configuration of place fields to represent each arena despite their differing geometry and eventual connection. These results highlight the ability of the hippocampus to retain consistent relationships between cells across long timescales and suggest that, in many cases, apparent instability might result from a coherent rotation of place fields.",,,,,,,,,"Kinsky, Nathaniel R. and Sullivan, David W. and Mau, William and Hasselmo, Michael E. and Eichenbaum, Howard B.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 12:56:53 +0200,2020-05-11 12:57:21 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2018.09.037,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,22,,,3578--3588.e6,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Hippocampal Place Fields Maintain a Coherent and Flexible Map across Long Timescales,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.09.037,28,2018,
article,Kirkpatrick2017PNAS,"Deep neural networks are currently the most successful machine-learning technique for solving a variety of tasks, including language translation, image classification, and image generation. One weakness of such models is that, unlike humans, they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In this work we propose a practical solution to train such models sequentially by protecting the weights important for previous tasks. This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially.The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.",,,,,,,,,"Kirkpatrick, James and Pascanu, Razvan and Rabinowitz, Neil and Veness, Joel and Desjardins, Guillaume and Rusu, Andrei A. and Milan, Kieran and Quan, John and Ramalho, Tiago and Grabska-Barwinska, Agnieszka and Hassabis, Demis and Clopath, Claudia and Kumaran, Dharshan and Hadsell, Raia",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 13:52:37 +0100,2020-10-29 13:53:13 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1611835114,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/114/13/3521.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,3521--3526,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/114/13/3521,114,2017,

This emphasis ignores the fact that choices are strongly shaped by a rich representation of potential rewards. Here, using fMRI adaptation, we demonstrate that responses in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode a representation of the specific type of food reward predicted by a visual cue. By controlling for value across rewards and by linking each reward with two distinct stimuli, we could test for representations of reward--identity that were independent of associative information. Our results show reward--identity representations in a medial-caudal region of OFC, independent of the associated predictive stimulus. This contrasts with a more rostro-lateral OFC region encoding reward--identity representations tied to the predicate stimulus. This demonstration of adaptation in OFC to reward specific representations opens an avenue for investigation of more complex decision mechanisms that are not immediately accessible in standard analyses, which focus on correlates of average activity.",,,,,,,,,"Klein-Fl{\""u}gge, M.

Based on evidence from neurophysiological and behavioral studies mainly in humans and rodents, we consider the formation of long-term memory during sleep as an active systems consolidation process that is embedded in a process of global synaptic downscaling. Repeated neuronal replay of representations originating from the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep leads to a gradual transformation and integration of representations in neocortical networks. We highlight three features of this process: (i) hippocampal replay that, by capturing episodic memory aspects, drives consolidation of both hippocampus-dependent and non-hippocampus-dependent memory; (ii) brain oscillations hallmarking slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep that provide mechanisms for regulating both information flow across distant brain networks and local synaptic plasticity; and (iii) qualitative transformations of memories during systems consolidation resulting in abstracted, gist-like representations.",,,,,,,,,"Klinzing, Jens G. and Niethard, Niels and Born, Jan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-01 14:32:00 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1038/s41593-019-0467-3,,,,,,,,,,,,1546-1726,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,10,,,1598--1610,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,replay; review,,Mechanisms of systems memory consolidation during sleep,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0467-3,22,2019,

article,Knudsen2020B,"The hippocampus is thought to encode a {\textquoteright}cognitive map{\textquoteright}, a structural organization of knowledge about relationships in the world. Place cells, spatially selective hippocampal neurons that have been extensively studied in rodents, are one component of this map, describing the relative position of environmental features. However, whether this map extends to abstract, cognitive information remains unknown. Using the relative reward value of cues to define continuous {\textquoteright}paths{\textquoteright} through an abstract value space, we show that single neurons in primate hippocampus encode this space through value place fields, much like a rodent{\textquoteright}s place neurons encode paths through physical space. Value place fields remapped when cues changed, but also became increasingly correlated across contexts, allowing maps to become generalized. Our findings help explain the critical contribution of the hippocampus to value-based decision-making, providing a mechanism by which knowledge of relationships in the world can be incorporated into reward predictions for guiding decisions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Knudsen, Eric B and Wallis, Joni D",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-20 13:57:27 +0100,2020-12-20 13:58:00 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.17.423272,,,,,2020.12.17.423272,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/17/2020.12.17.423272.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Hippocampal neurons construct a map of an abstract value space,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/17/2020.12.17.423272,,2020,
article,Knudsen2020N,"Neuronal oscillations in the frontal cortex have been hypothesized to play a role in the organization of high-level cognition. Within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), there is a prominent oscillation in the theta frequency (4--8 Hz) during reward-guided behavior, but it is unclear whether this oscillation has causal significance. One methodological challenge is that it is difficult to manipulate theta without affecting other neural signals, such as single-neuron firing rates. A potential solution is to use closed-loop control to record theta in real time and use this signal to control the application of electrical microstimulation to the OFC. Using this method, we show that theta oscillations in the OFC are critically important for reward-guided learning and that they are driven by theta oscillations in the hippocampus (HPC). The ability to disrupt OFC computations via spatially localized and temporally precise stimulation could lead to novel treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders involving OFC dysfunction.",,,,,,,,,"Knudsen, Eric B. and Wallis, Joni D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 12:03:07 +0200,2020-06-11 12:03:36 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2020.02.003,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,3,,,537--547.e4,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Closed-Loop Theta Stimulation in the Orbitofrontal Cortex Prevents Reward-Based Learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.02.003,106,2020,
article,Koay2021B,"Recent work has highlighted that many types of variables are represented in each neocortical area. How can these many neural representations be organized together without interference, and coherently maintained/updated through time? We recorded from large neural populations in posterior cortices as mice performed a complex, dynamic task involving multiple interrelated variables. The neural encoding implied that correlated task variables were represented by uncorrelated neural-population modes, while pairs of neurons exhibited a variety of signal correlations. This finding relates to principles of efficient coding for task-specific information, with neural-population modes as the encoding unit, and applied across posterior cortical regions and layers 2/3 and 5. Remarkably, this encoding function was multiplexed with sequential neural dynamics as well as reliably followed changes in task-variable correlations through time. We suggest that neural circuits can implement time-dependent encoding in a simple way by using random sequential dynamics as a temporal scaffold.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Koay, Sue Ann and Charles, Adam S. and Thiberge, Stephan Y. and Brody, Carlos D. and Tank, David W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-21 11:52:22 +0100,2021-01-21 11:52:44 +0100,,,10.1101/801654,,,,,801654,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/01/18/801654.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Sequential and efficient neural-population coding of complex task information,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/01/18/801654,,2021,

Computational models implicate age-related neural dedifferentiation on the level of item representations, but previous studies mostly focused on age differences of categorical information representation in higher-order visual regions. In an age-comparative fMRI study, we combined univariate analyses and whole-brain searchlight pattern similarity analyses to elucidate age differences in neural distinctiveness at both category and item levels and their relation to memory. Age-related neural dedifferentiation was shown as reduced category-selective processing in ventral visual cortex and impoverished item specificity in occipital regions.

article,Koch2019B,"Human aging is characterized by impaired spatial cognition and reductions in the distinctiveness of category-specific fMRI activation patterns. Yet, little is know about age-related decline in neural distinctiveness of spatial information. Here, we asked whether neural tuning functions of walking direction are broadened in older versus younger adults. To test this idea, we developed a novel method that allowed us to investigate changes in fMRI-measured pattern similarity while participants navigated in different directions in a virtual spatial navigation task. We expected that directional tuning functions would be broader in older adults, and thus activation patterns that reflect neighboring directions would be less distinct as compared to non-adjacent directions. Because loss of distinctiveness leads to more confusions when information is read out by downstream areas, we analyzed predictions of a decoder trained on these representations and asked (1) whether decoder confusions between two directions increase proportionally to their angular similarity, (2) and how this effect may differ between age groups. Evidence for tuning-function-like signals was found in the retrosplenial complex and primary visual cortex. Significant age differences in tuning width, however, were only found in the primary visual cortex, suggesting that less precise visual information could lead to worse directional signals in older adults. Yet, age differences in visual tuning were not related to behavior. Instead, directional information encoded in RSC correlated with memory on task. These results shed new light on neural mechanisms underling age-related spatial navigation impairments and introduce a novel approach to measure tuning specificity using fMRI.",,,,,,,,,"Koch, Christoph and Li, Shu-Chen and Polk, Thad A and Schuck, Nicolas W",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-03 18:32:31 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/791228,,,,,791228,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/10/02/791228.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Effects of Aging on the Encoding of Spatial Direction in the Human Brain,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/10/02/791228,,2019,
article,Kok2018JN,"Perception can be cast as a process of inference, in which bottom-up signals are combined with top-down predictions in sensory systems. In line with this, neural activity in sensory cortex is strongly modulated by prior expectations. Such top-down predictions often arise from cross-modal associations, such as when a sound (e.g., bell or bark) leads to an expectation of the visual appearance of the corresponding object (e.g., bicycle or dog). We hypothesized that the hippocampus, which rapidly learns arbitrary relationships between stimuli over space and time, may be involved in forming such associative predictions. We exposed male and female human participants to auditory cues predicting visual shapes, while measuring high-resolution fMRI signals in visual cortex and the hippocampus. Using multivariate reconstruction methods, we discovered a dissociation between these regions: representations in visual cortex were dominated by whichever shape was presented, whereas representations in the hippocampus reflected only which shape was predicted by the cue. The strength of hippocampal predictions correlated across participants with the amount of expectation-related facilitation in visual cortex.

Memory performance was high and remained quite high (82% accuracy) with 16 exemplars from a category in memory, demonstrating a large memory capacity for object exemplars. However, memory performance decreased as more exemplars were held in memory, implying systematic categorical interference. Object categories with conceptually distinctive exemplars showed less interference in memory as the number of exemplars increased.

The neural mechanisms that support such precise memory recall remain unclear. Here, using ultra-high field 7T MRI we reveal two distinct mechanisms that protect memories from interference. The first mechanism involves the hippocampus, where the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal predicts behavioral measures of memory interference, and representations of context-dependent memories are pattern separated according to their relational overlap. The second mechanism involves neocortical inhibition. When we reduce the concentration of neocortical GABA using trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), neocortical memory interference increases in proportion to the reduction in GABA, which in turn predicts behavioral performance.

article,Koopman2020B,"Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) is a technique by which sounds paired with learned information can be used to cue neural reactivation of that information during sleep. While TMR in slow-wave sleep (SWS) has been shown to strengthen procedural memories, it is unclear whether TMR in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a state strongly associated with motor consolidation, provides equivalent benefit. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this technique influences dominant and non-dominant hands equally. We applied TMR of a two-handed serial reaction time task (SRTT) during either SWS or REM in thirty-two human right handed adults (sixteen female) to examine the impact of stimulation in each sleep stage on right (dominant) and left hands. While TMR in SWS led to strong benefits in reaction times and sequence-specific skill, equivalent cueing in REM led to no benefit at all, suggesting that reactivation in this sleep stage is not important for the SRTT. Event-related potentials elicited by TMR cues for left and right hand movements differed significantly in REM, but not SWS, showing that these cues are at least processed in REM. Interestingly, TMR benefits were apparent only in the non-dominant hand, potentially due to the weaker performance measured in this hand at the outset. Overall, these findings suggest that memory replay in SWS, but not REM, is important for consolidation of the SRTT, and TMR-cued consolidation is stronger in the non-dominant hand.Significance statement Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) in sleep leads to memory consolidation, but many aspects of this process remain to be understood. We used TMR of a bimanual serial reaction time task to show that behavioural benefit is only observed after stimulation in SWS, even though electrophysiology shows that the TMR cues are processed in REM. Importantly, TMR selectively benefitted the non-dominant hand. These findings suggest that TMR in REM does not benefit this serial reaction time task, and that TMR in SWS preferentially consolidates weaker memory traces relating to the non-dominant hand.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Koopman, Anne C.

article,Koppe2020N,"Psychiatry today must gain a better understanding of the common and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders in order to deliver more effective, person-tailored treatments. To this end, it appears that the analysis of `small' experimental samples using conventional statistical approaches has largely failed to capture the heterogeneity underlying psychiatric phenotypes. Modern algorithms and approaches from machine learning, particularly deep learning, provide new hope to address these issues given their outstanding prediction performance in other disciplines. The strength of deep learning algorithms is that they can implement very complicated, and in principle arbitrary predictor-response mappings efficiently. This power comes at a cost, the need for large training (and test) samples to infer the (sometimes over millions of) model parameters. This appears to be at odds with the as yet rather `small' samples available in psychiatric human research to date (n < 10,000), and the ambition of predicting treatment at the single subject level (n = 1). Here, we aim at giving a comprehensive overview on how we can yet use such models for prediction in psychiatry. We review how machine learning approaches compare to more traditional statistical hypothesis-driven approaches, how their complexity relates to the need of large sample sizes, and what we can do to optimally use these powerful techniques in psychiatric neuroscience.",,,,,,,,,"Koppe, Georgia and Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas and Durstewitz, Daniel",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-22 12:38:23 +0200,2020-07-22 12:38:50 +0200,,,10.1038/s41386-020-0767-z,,,,,,,,,,,,1740-634X,,,Neuropsychopharmacology,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Deep learning for small and big data in psychiatry,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-0767-z,,2020,

article,Kovacs2016P,"During hippocampal sharp wave/ripple (SWR) events, previously occurring, sensory input-driven neuronal firing patterns are replayed. Such replay is thought to be important for plasticity-related processes and consolidation of memory traces. It has previously been shown that the electrical stimulation-induced disruption of SWR events interferes with learning in rodents in different experimental paradigms. On the other hand, the cognitive map theory posits that the plastic changes of the firing of hippocampal place cells constitute the electrophysiological counterpart of the spatial learning, observable at the behavioral level. Therefore, we tested whether intact SWR events occurring during the sleep/rest session after the first exploration of a novel environment are needed for the stabilization of the CA1 code, which process requires plasticity. We found that the newly-formed representation in the CA1 has the same level of stability with optogenetic SWR blockade as with a control manipulation that delivered the same amount of light into the brain. Therefore our results suggest that at least in the case of passive exploratory behavior, SWR-related plasticity is dispensable for the stability of CA1 ensembles.",,,,,,,,,"Kov{\'a}cs, Kriszti{\'a}n A. and O'Neill, Joseph and Schoenenberger, Philipp and Penttonen, Markku and Ranguel Guerrero, Damaris K. and Csicsvari, Jozsef",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL2tvdmFjczIwMTZwLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w9rb3ZhY3MyMDE2cC5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6a292YWNzMjAxNnAucGRmAA4AIAAPAGsAbwB2AGEAYwBzADIAMAAxADYAcAAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9rb3ZhY3MyMDE2cC5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 15:02:48 +0100,2020-12-14 15:03:41 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0164675,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,10,,,1-19,,,,Public Library of Science,,,,,,,,Optogenetically Blocking Sharp Wave Ripple Events in Sleep Does Not Interfere with the Formation of Stable Spatial Representation in the CA1 Area of the Hippocampus,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164675,11,2016,
article,Krakauer2017N,"There are ever more compelling tools available for neuroscience research, ranging from selective genetic targeting to optogenetic circuit control to mapping whole connectomes. These approaches are coupled with a deep-seated, often tacit, belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between the brain and behavior. The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering component processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implementation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work.

article,Kraus2013N,"Recent studies have reported the existence of hippocampal ``time cells,'' neurons that fire at particular moments during periods when behavior and location are relatively constant. However, an alternative explanation of apparent time coding is that hippocampal neurons ``path integrate'' to encode the distance an animal has traveled. Here, we examined hippocampal neuronal firing patterns as rats ran in place on a treadmill, thus ``clamping'' behavior and location, while we varied the treadmill speed to distinguish time elapsed from distance traveled. Hippocampal neurons were strongly influenced by time and distance, and less so by minor variations in location. Furthermore, the activity of different neurons reflected integration over time and distance to varying extents, with most neurons strongly influenced by both factors and some significantly influenced by only time or distance. Thus, hippocampal neuronal networks captured both the organization of time and distance in a situation where these dimensions dominated an ongoing experience.",,,,,,,,,"Kraus, Benjamin J. and Robinson, Robert J. and White, John A. and Eichenbaum, Howard and Hasselmo, Michael E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-13 15:40:04 +0100,2021-01-13 15:40:30 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2013.04.015,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,1090 - 1101,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampal ``Time Cells'': Time versus Path Integration,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313003176,78,2013,
article,Kriegeskorte2008FSN,"A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.",,,,,,,,,"Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus and Mur, Marieke and Bandettini, Peter A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-30 20:56:16 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5137,,,Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,"fMRI, electrophysiology, computational modeling, population code, similarity, representation",,Representational similarity analysis -- connecting the branches of systems neuroscience,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008,,2008,

However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question.

article,Krystal2017BP,"The functional optimization of neural ensembles is central to human higher cognitive functions. When the functions through which neural activity is tuned fail to develop or break down, symptoms and cognitive impairments arise. This review considers ways in which disturbances in the balance of excitation and inhibition might develop and be expressed in cortical networks in association with schizophrenia. This presentation is framed within a developmental perspective that begins with disturbances in glutamate synaptic development in utero. It considers developmental correlates and consequences, including compensatory mechanisms that increase intrinsic excitability or reduce inhibitory tone. It also considers the possibility that these homeostatic increases in excitability have potential negative functional and structural consequences. These negative functional consequences of disinhibition may include reduced working memory--related cortical activity associated with the downslope of the ``inverted-U'' input--output curve, impaired spatial tuning of neural activity and impaired sparse coding of information, and deficits in the temporal tuning of neural activity and its implication for neural codes. The review concludes by considering the functional significance of noisy activity for neural network function. The presentation draws on computational neuroscience and pharmacologic and genetic studies in animals and humans, particularly those involving N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonists, to illustrate principles of network regulation that give rise to features of neural dysfunction associated with schizophrenia.

article,Kudrimoti1999JN,"During slow wave sleep (SWS), traces of neuronal activity patterns from preceding behavior can be observed in rat hippocampus and neocortex. The spontaneous reactivation of these patterns is manifested as the reinstatement of the distribution of pairwise firing-rate correlations within a population of simultaneously recorded neurons. The effects of behavioral state [quiet wakefulness, SWS, and rapid eye movement (REM)], interactions between two successive spatial experiences, and global modulation during 200 Hz electroencephalographic (EEG) ``ripples'' on pattern reinstatement were studied in CA1 pyramidal cell population recordings. Pairwise firing-rate correlations during often repeated experiences accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in these interactions in subsequent SWS or quiet wakefulness and, to a lesser degree, during SWS before the experience on a given day. The latter effect was absent for novel experiences, suggesting that a persistent memory trace develops with experience. Pattern reinstatement was strongest during sharp wave--ripple oscillations, suggesting that these events may reflect system convergence onto attractor states corresponding to previous experiences. When two different experiences occurred in succession, the statistically independent effects of both were evident in subsequent SWS. Thus, the patterns of neural activity reemerge spontaneously, and in an interleaved manner, and do not necessarily reflect persistence of an active memory (i.e., reverberation). Firing-rate correlations during REM sleep were not related to the preceding familiar experience, possibly as a consequence of trace decay during the intervening SWS. REM episodes also did not detectably influence the correlation structure in subsequent SWS, suggesting a lack of strengthening of memory traces during REM sleep, at least in the case of familiar experiences.",,,,,,,,,"Kudrimoti, Hemant S. and Barnes, Carol A. and McNaughton, Bruce L.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAdLi4vcGFwZXJzL2t1ZHJpbW90aTE5OTlqbi5wZGZPEQF2AAAAAAF2AAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8Ta3Vkcmltb3RpMTk5OWpuLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAABQREYgQ0FSTwABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAEIvOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOmt1ZHJpbW90aTE5OTlqbi5wZGYADgAoABMAawB1AGQAcgBpAG0AbwB0AGkAMQA5ADkAOQBqAG4ALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgBAVXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMva3Vkcmltb3RpMTk5OWpuLnBkZgATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABEAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb4=,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-19 15:41:01 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.19-10-04090.1999,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,10,,,4090--4101,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,replay,,"Reactivation of Hippocampal Cell Assemblies: Effects of Behavioral State, Experience, and EEG Dynamics",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-10-04090.1999,19,1999,

To assess reactivation, we used multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, quantifying the degree to which retrieval events elicited patterns of neural activity that matched those elicited during encoding. Consistent with recent evidence, we found that retrieval of visual memories was associated with robust VOTC reactivation and that the degree of reactivation scaled with behavioral expressions of target memory retrieval. Critically, competitive remembering was associated with more ambiguous patterns of VOTC reactivation, putatively reflecting simultaneous reactivation of target and competing memories. Indeed, the more weakly that target memories were reactivated, the more likely that competing memories were later remembered. Moreover, when VOTC reactivation indicated that conflict between target and competing memories was high, frontoparietal mechanisms were markedly engaged, revealing specific neural mechanisms that tracked competing mnemonic evidence. Together, these findings provide unique evidence that neural reactivation captures competition between individual memories, providing insight into how well target memories are retrieved in the present and how likely competing memories will be remembered in the future.",,,,,,,,,"Kuhl, Brice A. and Rissman, Jesse and Chun, Marvin M. and Wagner, Anthony D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-02 12:01:26 +0100,2020-11-02 12:01:44 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1016939108,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5903.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,5903--5908,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Fidelity of neural reactivation reveals competition between memories,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5903,108,2011,
article,Kuhrt2020B,"Advances in virtual reality (VR) technology have greatly benefited spatial navigation research. By presenting space in a controlled manner, changing aspects of the environment one at a time or manipulating the gain from different sensory inputs, the mechanisms underlying behaviour can be investigated. In parallel, a growing body of evidence suggests that the processes involved in spatial navigation extend to non-spatial domains. Here, we leverage VR technology advances to test whether participants can navigate abstract knowledge. We designed a two-dimensional quantity space - presented using a head-mounted display - to test if participants can navigate abstract knowledge using a first-person perspective navigation paradigm. To investigate the effect of physical movement, we divided participants into two groups: one walking and rotating on a motion platform, the other group using a gamepad to move through the abstract space. We found that both groups learned to navigate using a first-person perspective and formed accurate representations of the abstract space. Interestingly, exploratory behaviour in the abstract space resembled behavioural patterns observed in spatial navigation studies. Notably, both groups demonstrated similar patterns of learning. Taken together, these results imply that both self-movement and remote exploration can be used to learn the relational mapping between abstract, non-spatial stimuli.",,,,,,,,,"Kuhrt, Doerte and St. John, Natalie R. and Bellmund, Jacob L.

article,Kumaran2012FHN,"Empirical research and theoretical accounts have traditionally emphasized the function of the hippocampus in episodic memory. Here we draw attention to the importance of the hippocampus to generalization, and focus on the neural representations and computations that might underpin its role in tasks such as the paired associate inference (PAI) paradigm. We make a principal distinction between two different mechanisms by which the hippocampus may support generalization: an encoding-based mechanism that creates overlapping representations which capture higher-order relationships between different items [e.g., Temporal Context Model (TCM): Howard et al., <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B21"">2005</xref>]---and a retrieval-based model [Recurrence with Episodic Memory Results in Generalization (REMERGE): Kumaran and McClelland, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B29"">in press</xref>] that effectively computes these relationships at the point of retrieval, through a recurrent mechanism that allows the dynamic interaction of multiple pattern separated episodic codes. We also discuss what we refer to as transfer effects---a more abstract example of generalization that has also been linked to the function of the hippocampus. We consider how this phenomenon poses inherent challenges for models such as TCM and REMERGE, and outline the potential applicability of a separate class of models---hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) in this context. Our hope is that this article will provide a basic framework within which to consider the theoretical mechanisms underlying the role of the hippocampus in generalization, and at a minimum serve as a stimulus for future work addressing issues that go to the heart of the function of the hippocampus.",,,,,,,,,"Kumaran, Dharshan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 17:45:14 +0100,2021-01-18 17:45:30 +0100,,,10.3389/fnhum.2012.00157,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5161,,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,157,,,,,,,,,,,,What representations and computations underpin the contribution of the hippocampus to generalization and inference?,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00157,6,2012,

Here, we pit the two theories against each other using a novel paradigm in which the relational processing involved in navigating in a city was matched with similar navigational and relational processing demands in a nonspatial (social) domain. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants determined the optimal route either between friends{\textquoteright} homes or between the friends themselves using social connections. Separate brain networks were engaged preferentially during the two tasks, with hippocampal activation driven only by spatial relational processing.

article,Kumaran2012PR,"In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization---as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.",,,,,,,,,"Kumaran, Dharshan and McClelland, James L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-08 13:45:24 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1037/a0028681,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-295X,,,Psychological Review,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,3,,,573--616,,,,American Psychological Association (APA),,,,,,replay; hippocampus; modeling,,Generalization through the recurrent interaction of episodic memories: A model of the hippocampal system.,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0028681,119,2012,

Recent advances in neuroscience have made it possible to discern these brain states in various ways.

In humans, individual memories have been associated with unique brain patterns via multivariate analysis techniques of electrophysiological and neuroimaging data. In the following chapter, we will review the advent of engram research in both animal and human memory studies.

In a sensory preconditioning paradigm, 'indirect' objects were paired with 'direct' objects to form associative links, and the latter were then paired with rewards. Using multivariate analysis methods we examined the short-time evolution of neural representations of indirect objects retrieved during reward-learning about direct objects. We found two components of the evoked representation of the indirect stimulus, 200 ms apart.

During these object-free periods, the brain spontaneously visited representations of approximately four objects in fast sequences lasting on the order of 120 ms.

Blood flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion recovery (IR), tissue relaxation parameter T1-sensitive pulse sequence. A series of images were acquired continuously with the same imaging pulse sequence (either GE or IR) during task activation. Cine display of subtraction images (activated minus baseline) directly demonstrates activity-induced changes in brain MR signal observed at a temporal resolution of seconds. During 8-Hz patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase in signal intensity (paired t test; P less than 0.001) of 1.8% +/- 0.8% (GE) and 1.8% +/- 0.9% (IR) was observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) of seven normal volunteers. The mean rise-time constant of the signal change was 4.4 +/- 2.2 s for the GE images and 8.9 +/- 2.8 s for the IR images. The stimulation frequency dependence of visual activation agrees with previous positron emission tomography observations, with the largest MR signal response occurring at 8 Hz. Similar signal changes were observed within the human primary motor cortex (M1) during a hand squeezing task and in animal models of increased blood flow by hypercapnia.

article,Kali2004NN,"During sleep, neural activity in the hippocampus and neocortex seems to recapitulate aspects of its earlier, awake form. This replay may be a substrate for the consolidation of long-term declarative memories, whereby they become independent of the hippocampus and are stored in neocortex. In contrast to storage, other crucial facets of competent long-term memory, such as maintenance of access to stored traces and preservation of their correct interpretation, have received little attention. We investigate long-term episodic and semantic memory in a theoretical model of neocortical-hippocampal interaction. We find that, in the absence of regular hippocampal reactivation, even supposedly consolidated episodic memories are fragile in the face of cortical semantic plasticity. Replay allows access to episodes stored in the hippocampus to be maintained, by keeping them in appropriate register with changing neocortical representations. Hippocampal storage and replay also has a constructive role in the recall of structured, semantic information.",,,,,,,,,"K{\'a}li, Szabolcs and Dayan, Peter",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-01 11:54:46 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/nn1202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,286--294,,,,,,,,,,,,Off-line replay maintains declarative memories in a model of hippocampal-neocortical interactions,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1202,7,2004,

Specifically, we apply the rapidly developing nonparametric prediction, activation, influence, and reproducibility resampling (NPAIRS) framework to obtain cross-validation-based model performance estimates of prediction accuracy and global reproducibility for various degrees of model complexity. We rely on the concept of an analysis chain meta-model in which all parameters of the preprocessing steps along with the final statistical model are treated as estimated model parameters. Our ROC analog, then, consists of plotting prediction vs. reproducibility results as curves of model complexity for competing meta-models. Two theoretical underpinnings are crucial to utilizing this new validation technique. First, we explore the relationship between global signal-to-noise and our reproducibility estimates as derived previously. Second, we submit our model complexity curves in the prediction versus reproducibility space as reflecting classic bias-variance tradeoffs.

article,LaBar2006NRN,"Amygdala damage in humans reduces the memory-enhancing benefits of emotional arousal on consolidation processes and on attentional focusing during encoding.Memories for stressful and emotionally arousing events benefit from moderate doses of adrenaline and cortisol released acutely at the time of encoding. These effects have been linked to amygdala function in human and non-human animal studies.By contrast, chronic stress or high levels of acute stress hormones impair memory retrieval and hippocampal function, as exemplified by post-traumatic stress disorder.Encoding of emotionally arousing events recruits amygdala activity and elicits greater functional interactions between the amygdala and medial temporal lobe memory regions, which result in enhanced long-term memory.The interactions between the amygdala and medial temporal lobe memory regions extend to retrieval of remote memories, including those from the remote personal past.Emotional memories are retrieved with an accompanying sense of recollection rather than familiarity, an effect that depends on co-activation of the amygdala and hippocampus.The prefrontal cortex also has a role in the encoding and retrieval of emotional events and shows regional specialization for arousal and valence effects on memory.Across various species, the acquisition of conditioned fear depends on the integrity of the amygdala and its interactions with the thalamus and cortical structures.The extinction of fear behaviour requires a suppressive influence of the prefrontal cortex on amygdala function, and contextual cues processed by the hippocampus can reinstate extinguished fears. These cortical control mechanisms over emotional learning are thought to contribute to relapse of fears and phobias in anxiety disorders.",,,,,,,,,"LaBar, Kevin S and Cabeza, Roberto",,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,,,,,,,,,2006/01/01,,2021-01-19 10:15:53 +0100,2021-01-19 10:16:05 +0100,,,10.1038/nrn1825,,,,,,,,,LaBar2006,,1471-0048,,,,Nature Reviews Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,54--64,,,,,,,,,,,,Cognitive neuroscience of emotional memory,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1825,7,2006,

article,Lake2016BBS,"Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

article,Lampinen2020PNAS,"An intelligent system should be able to adapt to a novel task without any data and achieve at least moderate success. Humans can often do so, while models often require immense datasets to reach human-level performance. We propose a general computational framework by which models can adapt to new tasks based only on their relationship to old tasks. Our approach is based on transforming learned task representations. Our approach allows models to perform well on novel tasks, even using novel relationships not encountered during training. This adaptation can substantially accelerate later learning. Our work could contribute to understanding the computational basis of intelligence, to cognitive modeling, and to building more flexible forms of artificial intelligence.An important aspect of intelligence is the ability to adapt to a novel task without any direct experience (zero shot), based on its relationship to previous tasks. Humans can exhibit this cognitive flexibility. By contrast, models that achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks often fail to adapt to even slight task alterations. To address this, we propose a general computational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship to prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt to new tasks, we propose metamappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic task representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across a wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to image classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human adaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these domains, metamapping is successful, often achieving 80 to 90\% performance, without any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts prior experience. We further show that metamapping can not only generalize to new tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel relationships unseen during training. Finally, using metamapping as a starting point can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task and reduce learning time and cumulative error substantially. Our results provide insight into a possible computational basis of intelligent adaptability and offer a possible framework for modeling cognitive flexibility and building more flexible artificial intelligence systems.All study data are included in this article and SI Appendix.",,,,,,,,,"Lampinen, Andrew K. and McClelland, James L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 11:47:36 +0100,2020-12-14 11:47:54 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.2008852117,,,,,202008852,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/09/2008852117.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Transforming task representations to perform novel tasks,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/09/2008852117,,2020,

We demonstrate a prolonged reactivation in rat ventral striatum during quiet wakefulness and slow-wave but not rapid eye movement sleep. Reactivation of reward-related information processed in this structure was particularly prominent, and this was primarily attributable to spike trains temporally linked to reward sites. It was accounted for by small, strongly correlated subgroups in recorded cell assemblies and can thus be characterized as a sparse phenomenon.

article,Lansink2012JN,"Forming place-reward associations critically depends on the integrity of the hippocampal{\textendash}ventral striatal system. The ventral striatum (VS) receives a strong hippocampal input conveying spatial-contextual information, but it is unclear how this structure integrates this information to invigorate reward-directed behavior. Neuronal ensembles in rat hippocampus (HC) and VS were simultaneously recorded during a conditioning task in which navigation depended on path integration. In contrast to HC, ventral striatal neurons showed low spatial selectivity, but rather coded behavioral task phases toward reaching goal sites. Outcome-predicting cues induced a remapping of firing patterns in the HC, consistent with its role in episodic memory. VS remapped in conjunction with the HC, indicating that remapping can take place in multiple brain regions engaged in the same task. Subsets of ventral striatal neurons showed a {\textquotedblleft}flip{\textquotedblright} from high activity when cue lights were illuminated to low activity in intertrial intervals, or vice versa. The cues induced an increase in spatial information transmission and sparsity in both structures. These effects were paralleled by an enhanced temporal specificity of ensemble coding and a more accurate reconstruction of the animal{\textquoteright}s position from population firing patterns. Altogether, the results reveal strong differences in spatial processing between hippocampal area CA1 and VS, but indicate similarities in how discrete cues impact on this processing.",,,,,,,,,"Lansink, Carien S. and Jackson, Jadin C. and Lankelma, Jan V. and Ito, Rutsuko and Robbins, Trevor W. and Everitt, Barry J. and Pennartz, Cyriel M.A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-13 15:33:01 +0100,2021-01-13 15:33:27 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0593-12.2012,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/36/12444.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,,,12444--12459,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Reward Cues in Space: Commonalities and Differences in Neural Coding by Hippocampal and Ventral Striatal Ensembles,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/36/12444,32,2012,

The SWS sequences occurred intermittently in brief (∼100 ms) bursts, each compressing the behavioral sequence in time by approximately 20-fold.

article,Lehnert2020PCB,"Humans are capable of transferring abstract knowledge from one task to another. For example, in a right-hand-drive country, a driver has to use the right arm to operate the shifter. A driver who learned how to drive in a right-hand-drive country can adapt to operating a left-hand-drive car and use the other arm for shifting instead of re-learning how to drive. Despite the fact that both tasks require different coordination of motor skills, both tasks are the same in an abstract sense: In both tasks, a car is operated and there is the same progression from 1st to 2nd gear and so on. We study distinct algorithms by which a reinforcement learning agent can discover state representations that encode knowledge about a particular task, and evaluate how well they can generalize. Through a sequence of simulation results, we show that state abstractions that minimize errors in prediction about future reward outcomes generalize across tasks, even those that superficially differ in both the goals (rewards) and the transitions from one state to the next.

article,Leibold2020NN,"Hippocampal place cell populations are activated in sequences on multiple time scales during active behavior, resting and sleep states, suggesting that these sequences are the genuine dynamical motifs of the hippocampal circuit. Recently, prewired hippocampal place cell sequences have even been reported to correlate to future behaviors, but so far there is no explanation of what could be the computational benefits of such a mapping between intrinsic dynamical structure and external sensory inputs. Here, I propose a computational model in which a set of predefined internal sequences is used as a dynamical reservoir to construct a spatial map of a large unknown maze based on only a small number of salient landmarks. The model is based on a new variant of temporal difference learning and implements a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm.

inproceedings,Lengyel2007NIPS,"Recent experimental studies have focused on the specialization of different neural structures for different types of instrumental behavior. Recent theoretical work has provided normative accounts for why there should be more than one control system, and how the output of different controllers can be integrated. Two particlar controllers have been identified, one associated with a forward model and the prefrontal cortex and a second associated with computationally simpler, habitual, actor-critic methods and part of the striatum. We argue here for the normative appropriateness of an additional, but so far marginalized control system, associated with episodic memory, and involving the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. We analyze in depth a class of simple environments to show that episodic control should be useful in a range of cases characterized by complexity and inferential noise, and most particularly at the very early stages of learning, long before habitization has set in. We interpret data on the transfer of control from the hippocampus to the striatum in the light of this hypothesis.","Red Hook, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"Lengyel, M\'{a}t\'{e} and Dayan, Peter",,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,,,,,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems,,,,,,2020-10-29 17:36:53 +0100,2020-10-29 17:37:30 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9781605603520,,,,Neural Information Processing Systems,,,,,,,,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",,,,,,,8,,889--896,,,,Curran Associates Inc.,,,,NIPS'07,,,,Hippocampal Contributions to Control: The Third Way,,,,,,,2007,

article,Leonard2015JN,"Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are highly synchronous oscillatory field potentials that are thought to facilitate memory consolidation. SWRs typically occur during quiescent states, when neural activity reflecting recent experience is replayed. In rodents, SWRs also occur during brief locomotor pauses in maze exploration, where they appear to support learning during experience. In this study, we detected SWRs that occurred during quiescent states, but also during goal-directed visual exploration in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta). The exploratory SWRs showed peak frequency bands similar to those of quiescent SWRs, and both types were inhibited at the onset of their respective behavioral epochs. In apparent contrast to rodent SWRs, these exploratory SWRs occurred during active periods of exploration, e.g., while animals searched for a target object in a scene. SWRs were associated with smaller saccades and longer fixations. Also, when they coincided with target-object fixations during search, detection was more likely than when these events were decoupled. Although we observed high gamma-band field potentials of similar frequency to SWRs, only the SWRs accompanied greater spiking synchrony in neural populations. These results reveal that SWRs are not limited to off-line states as conventionally defined; rather, they occur during active and informative performance windows. The exploratory SWR in primates is an infrequent occurrence associated with active, attentive performance, which may indicate a new, extended role of SWRs during exploration in primates.",,,,,,,,,"Leonard, T.

article,Leonard2017CB,"The hippocampus plays an important role in memory for events that are distinct in space and time. One of the strongest, most synchronous neural signals produced by the hippocampus is the sharp-wave ripple (SWR), observed in a variety of mammalian species during offline behaviors, such as slow-wave sleep [1, 2, 3] and quiescent waking and pauses in exploration [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], leading to long-standing and widespread theories of its contribution to plasticity and memory during these inactive or immobile states [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Indeed, during sleep and waking inactivity, hippocampal SWRs in rodents appear to support spatial long-term and working memory [4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], but so far, they have not been linked to memory in primates. More recently, SWRs have been observed during active, visual scene exploration in macaques [24], opening up the possibility that these active-state ripples in the primate hippocampus are linked to memory for objects embedded in scenes. By measuring hippocampal SWRs in macaques during search for scene-contextualized objects, we found that SWR rate increased with repeated presentations. Furthermore, gaze during SWRs was more likely to be near the target object on repeated than on novel presentations, even after accounting for overall differences in gaze location with scene repetition. This proximity bias with repetition occurred near the time of target object detection for remembered targets. The increase in ripple likelihood near remembered visual objects suggests a link between ripples and memory in primates; specifically, SWRs may reflect part of a mechanism supporting the guidance of search based on past experience.",,,,,,,,,"Leonard, Timothy K. and Hoffman, Kari L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 10:12:50 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2016.11.027,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,2,,,257--262,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Sharp-Wave Ripples in Primates Are Enhanced near Remembered Visual Objects,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.11.027,27,2017,

Using eye tracking and multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data, we measured participants' dimensional attention as they performed a trial-and-error learning task in which only one of three stimulus dimensions was relevant for reward at any given time. Analysis of participants' choices revealed that attention biased both value computation during choice and value update during learning. Value signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and prediction errors in the striatum were similarly biased by attention. In turn, participants' focus of attention was dynamically modulated by ongoing learning. Attentional switches across dimensions correlated with activity in a frontoparietal attention network, which showed enhanced connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between switches.

article,Leontiev2007N,"The coupling of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) during brain activation can be characterized by an empirical index, n, defined as the ratio between fractional CBF change and fractional CMRO2 change. The combination of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging with CBF measurements from arterial spin labeling (ASL) provides a potentially powerful experimental approach for measuring n, but the reproducibility of the technique previously has not been assessed. In this study, inter-subject variance and intra-subject reproducibility of the method were determined. Block design %BOLD and %CBF responses to visual stimulation and mild hypercapnia (5% CO2) were measured, and these data were used to compute the BOLD scaling factor M, %CMRO2 change with activation, and the coupling index n. Reproducibility was determined for three approaches to defining regions-of-interest (ROIs): 1) Visual area V1 determined from prior retinotopic maps, 2) BOLD-activated voxels from a separate functional localizer, and 3) CBF-activated voxels from a separate functional localizer. For estimates of %BOLD, %CMRO2 and n, intra-subject reproducibility was found to be best for regions selected according to CBF activation. Among all fMRI measurements, estimates of n were the most robust and were substantially more stable within individual subjects (coefficient of variation, CV = 7.4%) than across the subject pool (CV = 36.9%). The stability of n across days, despite wider variability of CBF and CMRO2 responses, suggests that the reproducibility of blood flow changes is limited by variation in the oxidative metabolic demand. We conclude that the calibrated BOLD approach provides a highly reproducible measurement of n that can serve as a useful quantitative probe of the coupling of blood flow and energy metabolism in the brain.",,,,,,,,,"Leontiev, Oleg and Buxton, Richard B.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-20 14:20:50 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.10.044,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,1,,,175--184,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,MRI; methods,,"Reproducibility of {BOLD}, perfusion, and {CMRO2} measurements with {calibrated-BOLD fMRI}",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.10.044,35,2007,

All of these are examples of repugnant transactions---market transactions that third parties want to prevent. In two studies (N = 1,554), using respondents' judgements of 51 different market transactions across 21 characteristics, we show that repugnance can be characterized along five higher-order dimensions: moral outrage, need for regulation, incommensurability, exploitation, and unknown risk. Repugnance toward the 51 market transactions was highly consistent across two samples. Our results can help identify mismatches between public sentiments and current regulations (selling carbon emissions is currently legal but considered repugnant), anticipate responses to novel markets that have not been publicly scrutinized (often arising from technological advances, such as markets for ``designer babies''), and help design less repugnant markets (e.g., by making the risks involved in a transaction known to sellers).",,,,,,,,,"Leuker, Christina and Samartzidis, Lasare and Hertwig, Ralph",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-24 11:10:40 +0200,2020-04-24 11:11:18 +0200,,,10.31234/osf.io/dgz4s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,Center for Open Science,,,,,,,,What makes a market transaction morally repugnant?,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/dgz4s,,2020,

A defining property of an attractor network is its ability to undergo sharp and coherent transitions between pre-established (learned) representations when the inputs to the network are changed. To determine whether hippocampal neuronal ensembles exhibit such discontinuities, we recorded in CA3 and CA1 when a familiar square recording enclosure was morphed in quantifiable steps into a familiar circular enclosure while leaving other inputs constant. We observed a gradual noncoherent progression from the initial to the final network state. In CA3, the transformation was accompanied by significant hysteresis, resulting in more similar end states than when only square and circle were presented.

Prior to this, memory manipulation during sleep was atmost a plot device in science fiction movies, but a large corpus of studies now demonstrates that TMR isboth reliable and effective. TMR studies hypothesize that this method taps into normal consolidation mech-anisms that require the repeated replay of memories during sleep. This idea has recently been supported byseveral new studies demonstrating that TMR upregulates the reactivation of cued memories, and that suchupregulation predicts subsequent memory performance. This new body of work provides a unique windowonto many properties of memory reactivation and helps to close the gap between our understanding of replayin rodents, where it has been visualised at the neural level for many years, and humans, where such studiesare only just starting to become possible.

Sleep is known to be important for creative thinking, but there is a debate about which sleep stage is most relevant, and why. We address this issue by proposing that rapid eye movement sleep, or `REM', and non-REM sleep facilitate creativity in different ways. Memory replay mechanisms in non-REM can abstract rules from corpuses of learned information, while replay in REM may promote novel associations.

article,Li2003NN,"In addition to its role in memory formation, the hippocampus may act as a novelty detector. Here we investigated whether attention to novel events can promote the associative synaptic plasticity mechanisms believed to be necessary for storing those events in memory. We therefore examined whether exposure to a novel spatial environment promoted the induction of activity-dependent persistent increases in glutamatergic transmission (long-term potentiation, LTP) at CA1 synapses in the rat hippocampus. We found that brief exposure to a novel environment lowered the threshold for the induction of LTP. This facilitatory effect was present for a short period following novelty exposure but was absent in animals that explored a familiar environment. Furthermore, the facilitation was dependent on activation of D1/D5 receptors.

article,Liashenko2020SR,"Value-based decisions about alternatives we have never experienced can be guided by associations between current choice options and memories of prior reward. A critical question is how similar memories need to be to the current situation to effectively guide decisions. We address this question in the context of associative learning of faces using a sensory preconditioning paradigm. We find that memories of reward spread along established associations between faces to guide decision making. While memory guidance is specific for associated facial identities, it does not only occur for the specific images that were originally encountered. Instead, memory guidance generalizes across different images of the associated identities. This suggests that memory guidance does not rely on a pictorial format of representation but on a higher, view-invariant level of abstraction. Thus, memory guidance operates on a level of representation that neither over- nor underspecifies associative relationships in the context of obtaining reward.",,,,,,,,,"Liashenko, Anna and Dizaji, Aslan S. and Melloni, Lucia and Schwiedrzik, Caspar M.",,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,,,,,,,,,2020/12/09,,2021-01-19 13:08:53 +0100,2021-01-19 13:09:06 +0100,,,10.1038/s41598-020-78460-6,,,,,,,,,Liashenko2020,,2045-2322,,,,Scientific Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,21496,,,,,,,,,,,,Memory guidance of value-based decision making at an abstract level of representation,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78460-6,10,2020,
article,Lieblich1982BBS,"We argue that a map is meaningless unless we have a process for using it. Thus, in this paper, we not only offer the world graph as a representation of relationships among situations the animal has encountered and may encounter again, but we also offer algorithms for how the information encoded in the world graph may be used by the animal in determining its behavior. Each node of the graph encodes a recognizable situation in the animal's world, but a given place may well be encoded in a number of different nodes. Nodes not only require algorithms for the recognition of the situation; they store information about drive reduction associated with the encoded situation. We note that the use of graphs as a basis for exploring some search space is well known in artificial intelligence (AI), but we stress the importance of the animal's exploration of its environment for growing the graph, as distinct from the mathematically described potential nodes frequent in AI search spaces. To explore a number of hypotheses about the way information in the world graph is used to guide the animal's movement, we recall a number of classical experiments on maze exploration by animals, and use them to argue for the nonlocal hypothesis (selection of a path does not depend only upon information about the immediate environment of the animal) and the competing nodes hypothesis (more than one drive may enter into the determination of the animal's behavior at any time). An important feature of the model is that it yields exploration and latent learning without the introduction of an exploratory drive. We also note that the performance exhibited by the model appears to be state-dependent when the animal operates under high drive levels. The drive-interaction matrix is offered as a subject for future research. We complement the presentation of the world graph model, its drive dynamics, and how these are constrained by experiments on maze behavior, with a brief analysis of maps in the brain. We distinguish egocentric maps--which we relate to the many visual systems--from allocentric maps. We offer a somewhat unconventional view of short-term and long-term memory. We examine cooperative computation in somatotopically organized networks, relating this to visually guided behavior in the frog, and to the interaction of colliculus and cortex in the control of eye movements. We examine, but do not advocate, the hypothesis that the hippocampus is a cognitive map. We do stress that if it is a cognitive map, it must be seen as a chart of the local neighborhood, rather than the whole atlas; and we note that the cognitive map hypothesis would lead one to expect the region to exhibit activation of place cells before the animal leaves the previous place. {\copyright} 1982, Cambridge University Press.

article,Lillicrap2019CON,"It has long been speculated that the backpropagation-of-error algorithm (backprop) may be a model of how the brain learns. Backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) is the canonical temporal-analogue to backprop used to assign credit in recurrent neural networks in machine learning, but there's even less conviction about whether BPTT has anything to do with the brain. Even in machine learning the use of BPTT in classic neural network architectures has proven insufficient for some challenging temporal credit assignment (TCA) problems that we know the brain is capable of solving. Nonetheless, recent work in machine learning has made progress in solving difficult TCA problems by employing novel memory-based and attention-based architectures and algorithms, some of which are brain inspired. Importantly, these recent machine learning methods have been developed in the context of, and with reference to BPTT, and thus serve to strengthen BPTT's position as a useful normative guide for thinking about temporal credit assignment in artificial and biological systems alike.",,,,,,,,,"Lillicrap, Timothy P and Santoro, Adam",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 10:22:29 +0200,2020-05-11 10:22:53 +0200,,,10.1016/j.conb.2019.01.011,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-4388,,,Current Opinion in Neurobiology,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,82--89,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Backpropagation through time and the brain,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.01.011,55,2019,
article,Lillicrap2016NC,"The brain processes information through multiple layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks.

However, it has been shown to vary substantially across subjects, brain regions, and repetitive measurements. This variability represents a limit to the precision of the BOLD response and the ability to reliably discriminate brain hemodynamic responses elicited by external stimuli or behavior that are nearby in time. While the temporal variability of the BOLD signal at human visual cortex has been found in the range of a few hundreds of milliseconds, the spatial distributions of the average and standard deviation of this temporal variability have not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fMRI measurements with a high sampling rate (10Hz) to map the latency, intra- and inter-subject variability of the evoked BOLD signal in human primary (V1) visual cortices using an event-related fMRI paradigm. The latency relative to the average BOLD signal evoked by 30 stimuli was estimated to be 0.03$\pm$0.20s. Within V1, the absolute value of the relative BOLD latency was found correlated to intra- and inter-subject temporal variability. After comparing these measures to retinotopic maps, we found that locations with V1 areas sensitive to smaller eccentricity have later responses and smaller inter-subject variabilities. These correlations were found from data with either short inter-stimulus interval (ISI; average 4s) or long ISI (average 30s). Maps of the relative latency as well as inter-/intra-subject variability were found visually asymmetric between hemispheres. Our results suggest that the latency and variability of regional BOLD signal measured with high spatiotemporal resolution may be used to detect regional differences in hemodynamics to inform fMRI studies. However, the physiological origins of timing index distributions and their hemispheric asymmetry remain to be investigated.",,,,,,,,,"Lin, Fa-Hsuan and Polimeni, Jonathan R. and Lin, Jo-Fu Lotus and Tsai, Kevin W.-K. and Chu, Ying-Hua and Wu, Pu-Yeh and Li, Yi-Tien and Hsu, Yi-Cheng and Tsai, Shang-Yueh and Kuo, Wen-Jui",,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,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917300484,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.041,,,,,,,,,2019-09-06 10:38:13 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.041,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,"fMRI, V1, Stability, Retinotopy, Precision, Hemodynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,194 - 201,,,,,,,,,,highspeed,,Relative latency and temporal variability of hemodynamic responses at the human primary visual cortex,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917300484,164,2018,

Here, we recorded whole-head BOLD fMRI at 100 ms resolution and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a visuomotor reaction-time task. Both methods detected the same activation sequence across five regions, from visual towards motor cortices, with linearly correlated interregional BOLD and MEG response delays. The smallest significant interregional BOLD delay was 100 ms; all delays ≥ 400 ms were significant.

Self-improving, which involves trial and error, however, is often a slow process and could be hazardous in a hostile environment.

This paper presents a general approach to making robots which can improve their performance from experiences as well as from being taught. Based on this proposed approach and other learning speedup techniques, a simulated learning robot was developed and could learn three moderately complex behaviors, which were then integrated in a subsumption style so that the robot could navigate and recharge itself.

phdthesis,Lin1992CMU,"Reinforcement learning agents are adaptive, reactive, and self-supervised. The aim of this dissertation is to extend the state of the art of reinforcement learning and enable its applications to complex robot-learning problems. In particular, it focuses on two issues. First, learning from sparse and delayed reinforcement signals is hard and in general a slow process. Techniques for reducing learning time must be devised. Second, most existing reinforcement learning methods assume that the world is a Markov decision process. This assumption is too strong for many robot tasks of interest. This dissertation demonstrates how we can possibly overcome the slow learning problem and tackle non-Markovian environments, making reinforcement learning more practical for realistic robot tasks: (1) Reinforcement learning can be naturally integrated with artificial neural networks to obtain high-quality generalization, resulting in a significant learning speedup. Neural networks are used in this dissertation, and they generalize effectively even in the presence of noise and a large of binary and real-valued inputs. (2) Reinforcement learning agents can save many learning trials by using an action model, which can be learned on-line. With a model, an agent can mentally experience the effects of its actions without actually executing them. Experience replay is a simple technique that implements this idea, and is shown to be effective in reducing the number of action executions required. (3) Reinforcement learning agents can take advantage of instructive training instances provided by human teachers, resulting in a significant learning speedup. Teaching can also help learning agents avoid local optima during the search for optimal control. Simulation experiments indicate that even a small amount of teaching can save agents many learning trials. (4) Reinforcement learning agents can significantly reduce learning time by hierarchical learning--they first solve elementary learning problems and then combine solutions to the elementary problems to solve a complex problem. Simulation experiments indicate that a robot with hierarchical learning can solve a complex problem, which otherwise is hardly solvable within a reasonable time. (5) Reinforcement learning agents can deal with a wide range of non-Markovian environments by having a memory of their past. Three memory architectures are discussed. They work reasonably well for a variety of simple problems. One of them is also successfully applied to a nontrivial non-Markovian robot task.The results of this dissertation rely on computer simulation, including (1) an agent operating in a dynamic and hostile environment and (2) a mobile robot operating in a noisy and non-Markovian environment. The robot simulator is physically realistic. This dissertation concludes that it is possible to build artificial agents than can acquire complex control policies effectively by reinforcement learning.",USA,,,,,,,,"Lin, Long-Ji",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 12:46:36 +0100,2020-10-26 13:29:01 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,,School of Computer Science,,,,,Reinforcement Learning for Robots Using Neural Networks,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/168871,,1992,
article,Lin1992ML,"To date, reinforcement learning has mostly been studied solving simple learning tasks. Reinforcement learning methods that have been studied so far typically converge slowly. The purpose of this work is thus two-fold: 1) to investigate the utility of reinforcement learning in solving much more complicated learning tasks than previously studied, and 2) to investigate methods that will speed up reinforcement learning. This paper compares eight reinforcement learning frameworks:adaptive heuristic critic (AHC) learning due to Sutton,Q-learning due to Watkins, and three extensions to both basic methods for speeding up learning. The three extensions are experience replay, learning action models for planning, and teaching. The frameworks were investigated using connectionism as an approach to generalization. To evaluate the performance of different frameworks, a dynamic environment was used as a testbed. The environment is moderately complex and nondeterministic. This paper describes these frameworks and algorithms in detail and presents empirical evaluation of the frameworks.",,,,,,,,,"Lin, Long-Ji",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-13 10:36:33 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1007/bf00992699,,,,,,,,,,,,1573-0565,,,Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,3-4,,,293--321,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,replay; modeling,,"Self-improving reactive agents based on reinforcement learning, planning and teaching",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00992699,8,1992,
article,Linde-Domingo2019NC,"Remembering is a reconstructive process, yet little is known about how the reconstruction of a memory unfolds in time in the human brain. Here, we used reaction times and EEG time-series decoding to test the hypothesis that the information flow is reversed when an event is reconstructed from memory, compared to when the same event is initially being perceived. Across three experiments, we found highly consistent evidence supporting such a reversed stream. When seeing an object, low-level perceptual features were discriminated faster behaviourally, and could be decoded from brain activity earlier, than high-level conceptual features. This pattern reversed during associative memory recall, with reaction times and brain activity patterns now indicating that conceptual information was reconstructed more rapidly than perceptual details. Our findings support a neurobiologically plausible model of human memory, suggesting that memory retrieval is a hierarchical, multi-layered process that prioritises semantically meaningful information over perceptual details.",,,,,,,,,"Linde-Domingo, Juan and Treder, Matthias S. and Kerr{\'e}n, Casper and Wimber, Maria",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAhLi4vcGFwZXJzL2xpbmRlLWRvbWluZ28yMDE5bmMucGRmTxEBhgAAAAABhgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////F2xpbmRlLWRvbWluZ28yMDE5bmMucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAUERGIENBUk8AAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBGLzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpsaW5kZS1kb21pbmdvMjAxOW5jLnBkZgAOADAAFwBsAGkAbgBkAGUALQBkAG8AbQBpAG4AZwBvADIAMAAxADkAbgBjAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIARFVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL2xpbmRlLWRvbWluZ28yMDE5bmMucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEgAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB0g==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 15:28:57 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/s41467-018-08080-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,Nature Communications,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,1,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Evidence that neural information flow is reversed between object perception and object reconstruction from memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08080-2,10,2019,
article,Lisman1995S,"Psychophysical measurements indicate that human subjects can store approximately seven short-term memories. Physiological studies suggest that short-term memories are stored by patterns of neuronal activity. Here it is shown that activity patterns associated with multiple memories can be stored in a single neural network that exhibits nested oscillations similar to those recorded from the brain. Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency (""40 hertz"") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits.

article,Lisman1999N,"The hippocampus is composed of several regions, each of which is a network of 105 to 106 neurons. The pattern of excitatory synaptic connections within and between regions has been determined, and the ``wiring diagram'' is shown in Figure 1. The intricacies are striking and beg for explanation, but it remains unclear how the connections work together to perform a function. Indeed, more generally, the goal of relating network connectivity to function has not been achieved for any region of the vertebrate central nervous system, with the exception of the retina. For many brain regions, the goal is a distant one, because not even the function of the region is known. For the hippocampus, the goal appears attainable, because the general function of the hippocampus in memory processes is established. Many models that relate aspects of hippocampal circuitry to memory function have have been proposed, and these have become more refined as new information has been learned about the cellular, network, and functional properties of the hippocampus.

We developed a probabilistic statistical model of hippocampal spontaneous sequential activity and revealed existence of an internal model of generative predictive codes for the regularities of multiple future novel spatial sequences. During navigation, the inferred difference between external stimuli and the internal model was encoded by emergence of intrinsic-unlikely, novel functional connections, which updated the model by preferentially potentiating post-experience. This internal model and these predictive codes depended on neuronal organization into inferred modules of short, high-repeat sequential neuronal ``tuplets'' operating as ``neuro-codons.''

article,Liu2019H,"Spontaneous neuronal ensemble activity in the hippocampus is believed to result from a combination of preconfigured internally generated dynamics and the unique patterns of activity driven by recent experience. Previous research has established that preconfigured sequential neuronal patterns (i.e., preplay) contribute to the expression of future place cell sequences, which in turn contribute to the sequential neuronal patterns expressed post-experience (i.e., replay). The relative contribution of preconfigured and of experience-related factors to replay and to overall sequential activity during post-run sleep is believed to be highly biased toward the recent run experience, despite never being tested directly. Here, we use multi-neuronal sequence analysis unbiased by firing rate to compute and directly compare the contributions of internally generated and of recent experience-driven factors to the sequential neuronal activity in post-run sleep in na{\""\i}ve adult rats. We find that multi-neuronal sequences during post-run sleep are dominantly contributed by the pre-run preconfigured patterns and to a much smaller extent by the place cell sequences and associated awake rest multi-neuronal sequences experienced during de novo run session, which are weakly and similarly correlated with pre- and post-run sleep multi-neuronal sequences. These findings indicate a robust default internal organization of the hippocampal network into sequential neuronal ensembles that withstands a de novo spatial experience and suggest that integration of novel information during de novo experience leading to lasting changes in sequential network patterns is much more subtle than previously assumed.",,,,,,,,,"Liu, Kefei and Sibille, Jeremie and Dragoi, George",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAWLi4vcGFwZXJzL2xpdTIwMTloLnBkZk8RAVwAAAAAAVwAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////wxsaXUyMDE5aC5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAOy86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6bGl1MjAxOWgucGRmAAAOABoADABsAGkAdQAyADAAMQA5AGgALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA5VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvbGl1MjAxOWgucGRmAAATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJAA9AAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZ0=,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-21 20:05:45 +0100,2020-12-21 20:06:29 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.23034,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.23034,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"multi-neuronal sequences, neuronal ensembles, preplay, representations, sleep",,,,,,,,,,,3,,,275-283,,,,,,,,,,,,Preconfigured patterns are the primary driver of offline multi-neuronal sequence replay,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23034,29,2019,
article,Liu2018NC,"It has been suggested that reactivation of previously acquired experiences or stored information in declarative memories in the hippocampus and neocortex contributes to memory consolidation and learning. Understanding memory consolidation depends crucially on the development of robust statistical methods for assessing memory reactivation. To date, several statistical methods have seen established for assessing memory reactivation based on bursts of ensemble neural spike activity during offline states. Using population-decoding methods, we propose a new statistical metric, the weighted distance correlation, to assess hippocampal memory reactivation (i.e., spatial memory replay) during quiet wakefulness and slow-wave sleep. The new metric can be combined with an unsupervised population decoding analysis, which is invariant to latent state labeling and allows us to detect statistical dependency beyond linearity in memory traces. We validate the new metric using two rat hippocampal recordings in spatial navigation tasks. Our proposed analysis framework may have a broader impact on assessing memory reactivations in other brain regions under different behavioral tasks.",,,,,,,,,"Liu, Shizhao and Grosmark, Andres D. and Chen, Zhe",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAXLi4vcGFwZXJzL2xpdTIwMThuYy5wZGZPEQFeAAAAAAFeAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8NbGl1MjAxOG5jLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACADwvOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOmxpdTIwMThuYy5wZGYADgAcAA0AbABpAHUAMgAwADEAOABuAGMALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA6VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvbGl1MjAxOG5jLnBkZgATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJAA+AAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA=,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-28 12:11:59 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1162/neco_a_01090,,,,,,,,,,,,1530-888X,,,Neural Computation,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,8,,,2175--2209,,,,MIT Press - Journals,,,,,,,,Methods for Assessment of Memory Reactivation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01090,30,2018,

This reactivation is hypothesised to reflect a fundamental computation that supports a variety of cognitive functions. Here, we introduce an analysis toolkit (TDLM) for analysing this activity. TDLM combines nonlinear classification and linear temporal modelling to testing for statistical regularities in sequences of neural representations. It is developed using non-invasive neuroimaging data and is designed to take care of confounds and maximize sequence detection ability. The method can be extended to rodent electrophysiological recordings.

Here, we asked whether such abstract knowledge immediately guides the replay of new experiences. We first trained participants on a rule defining an ordering of objects and then presented a novel set of objects in a scrambled order. Across two studies, we observed that representations of these novel objects were reactivated during a subsequent rest. As in rodents, human ``replay'' events occurred in sequences accelerated in time, compared to actual experience, and reversed their direction after a reward. Notably, replay did not simply recapitulate visual experience, but followed instead a sequence implied by learned abstract knowledge. Furthermore, each replay contained more than sensory representations of the relevant objects. A sensory code of object representations was preceded 50 ms by a code factorized into sequence position and sequence identity.

article,Liu2020aB,"To make effective decisions we need to consider the relationship between actions and outcomes. They are, however, often separated by time and space. The biological mechanism capable of spanning those gaps remains unknown. One promising, albeit hypothetical, mechanism involves neural replay of non-local experience. Using a novel task, that segregates direct from indirect learning, combined with magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tested the role of neural replay in non-local learning in humans. Following reward receipt, we found significant backward replay of non-local experience, with a 160 msec state-to-state time lag, and this replay facilitated learning of action values. This backward replay, combined with behavioural evidence of non-local learning, was more pronounced in experiences that were of greater benefit for future behaviour, as predicted by theories of prioritization.

article,Logothetis2012N,"Hippocampal ripples, episodic high-frequency field-potential oscillations primarily occurring during sleep and calmness, have been described in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and humans, and so far they have been associated with retention of previously acquired awake experience. Although hippocampal ripples have been studied in detail using neurophysiological methods, the global effects of ripples on the entire brain remain elusive, primarily owing to a lack of methodologies permitting concurrent hippocampal recordings and whole-brain activity mapping. By combining electrophysiological recordings in hippocampus with ripple-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging, here we show that most of the cerebral cortex is selectively activated during the ripples, whereas most diencephalic, midbrain and brainstem regions are strongly and consistently inhibited. Analysis of regional temporal response patterns indicates that thalamic activity suppression precedes the hippocampal population burst, which itself is temporally bounded by massive activations of association and primary cortical areas. These findings suggest that during off-line memory consolidation, synergistic thalamocortical activity may be orchestrating a privileged interaction state between hippocampus and cortex by silencing the output of subcortical centres involved in sensory processing or potentially mediating procedural learning. Such a mechanism would cause minimal interference, enabling consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory.",,,,,,,,,"Logothetis, N.

Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses.

We show that development even under unstructured input increases unspecific sequence memory. Moreover, networks {\textquotedblleft}pre-shaped{\textquotedblright} by such unstructured input subsequently learn specific sequences faster. The key structural substrate is the emergence of strong and directed synapses due to STDP and synaptic competition.

article,Lu2020B,"When should episodic memories be stored and retrieved to support event understanding? Traditional list-learning memory experiments make it obvious when to store and retrieve memories, but it is less obvious when to do this in naturalistic settings. To address this question, we trained a memory-augmented neural network to predict upcoming events, in an environment where situations (sets of parameters governing transitions between events) sometimes reoccurred. The model was allowed to learn a policy for when to consult episodic memory, and we explored how this learned policy varied as a function of the task environment. We found that the learned retrieval policy is shaped by internal uncertainty about upcoming events, the level of penalty associated with incorrect predictions, the confusability of stored memories, the presence of a {\textquotedblleft}familiarity signal{\textquotedblright} indicating the availability of relevant memories, and the presence of statistical regularities (prototypical events). With regard to encoding policy, we found that selectively storing episodic memories at the end of an event (but not mid-event) leads to better subsequent event prediction performance and less incorrect recall. Additionally, we found that the model can integrate information over long timescales even without the hippocampus; it can link information over many event segments via episodic memory; and it shows classic schema-consistent memory effects when the upcoming time point has a prototypical event. Overall, these modeling results provide a normative explanation of several existing behavioral and neuroimaging findings regarding the use of episodic memory in naturalistic settings, and lead to a wide range of testable predictions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Lu, Qihong and Hasson, Uri and Norman, Kenneth A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-19 17:11:33 +0100,2021-01-19 17:11:52 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.15.422882,,,,,2020.12.15.422882,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/16/2020.12.15.422882.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Learning to use episodic memory for event prediction,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/16/2020.12.15.422882,,2020,
article,Ludvig2017B,"We develop an extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning. In addition to learning from the current trial, the new model supposes that animals store and replay previous trials, learning from the replayed trials using the same learning rule. This simple idea provides a unified explanation for diverse phenomena that have proved challenging to earlier associative models, including spontaneous recovery, latent inhibition, retrospective revaluation, and trial spacing effects. For example, spontaneous recovery is explained by supposing that the animal replays its previous trials during the interval between extinction and test. These include earlier acquisition trials as well as recent extinction trials, and thus there is a gradual re-acquisition of the conditioned response. We present simulation results for the simplest version of this replay idea, where the trial memory is assumed empty at the beginning of an experiment, all experienced trials are stored and none removed, and sampling from the memory is performed at random. Even this minimal replay model is able to explain the challenging phenomena, illustrating the explanatory power of an associative model enhanced by learning from remembered as well as real experiences.",,,,,,,,,"Ludvig, Elliot A. and Mirian, Mahdieh S. and Kehoe, E.

After allowing participants to make repeated choices between reward-conditioned stimuli, in the absence of any outcome, we observe that participants prefer stimuli they have previously chosen, and neglect previously unchosen stimuli, over otherwise identical-valued options. Using functional brain imaging, we show that decisions induce changes to hippocampal representations of stimulus-outcome associations. These changes are correlated with future decision biases.

However, the neural pathways that mediate context-reward relations are not well understood. We have identified a circuit from area CA3 of dorsal hippocampus to ventral tegmental area (VTA) that uses lateral septum (LS) as a relay. Theta frequency stimulation of CA3 excited VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and inhibited non-DA neurons. DA neuron excitation was likely mediated by disinhibition because local antagonism of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors blocked responses to CA3 stimulation. Inactivating components of the CA3-LS-VTA pathway blocked evoked responses in VTA and also reinstatement of cocaine-seeking by contextual stimuli. This transsynaptic link between hippocampus and VTA appears to be an important substrate by which environmental context regulates goal-directed behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Luo, Alice H. and Tahsili-Fahadan, Pouya and Wise, Roy A. and Lupica, Carl R. and Aston-Jones, Gary",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-19 11:21:31 +0100,2021-01-19 11:21:49 +0100,,,10.1126/science.1204622,,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6040/353.full.pdf,,,,,,0036-8075,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6040,,,353--357,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,,,Linking Context with Reward: A Functional Circuit from Hippocampal CA3 to Ventral Tegmental Area,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6040/353,333,2011,
article,Luo2018PS," A remarkable ability of the cognitive system is to make novel inferences on the basis of prior experiences. What mechanism supports such inferences? We propose that statistical learning is a process through which transitive inferences of new associations are made between objects that have never been directly associated. After viewing a continuous sequence containing two base pairs (e.g., A--B, B--C), participants automatically inferred a transitive pair (e.g., A--C) where the two objects had never co-occurred before (Experiment 1). This transitive inference occurred in the absence of explicit awareness of the base pairs. However, participants failed to infer the transitive pair from three base pairs (Experiment 2), showing the limits of the transitive inference (Experiment 3). We further demonstrated that this transitive inference can operate across the categorical hierarchy (Experiments 4--7). The findings revealed a novel consequence of statistical learning in which new transitive associations between objects are implicitly inferred.

article,Lynn2020PNAS,"Humans receive information from the world around them in sequences of discrete items---from words in language or notes in music to abstract concepts in books and websites on the Internet. To model their environment, from a young age people are tasked with learning the network structures formed by these items (nodes) and the connections between them (edges). But how do humans uncover the large-scale structures of networks when they experience only sequences of individual items? Moreover, what do people's internal maps and models of these networks look like? Here, we introduce graph learning, a growing and interdisciplinary field studying how humans learn and represent networks in the world around them. Specifically, we review progress toward understanding how people uncover the complex webs of relationships underlying sequences of items. We begin by describing established results showing that humans can detect fine-scale network structure, such as variations in the probabilities of transitions between items. We next present recent experiments that directly control for differences in transition probabilities, demonstrating that human behavior depends critically on the mesoscale and macroscale properties of networks. Finally, we introduce computational models of human graph learning that make testable predictions about the impact of network structure on people's behavior and cognition.

Using the free energy principle, which bridges information theory and Bayesian inference, we derive a maximum entropy model of people's internal representations of the transitions between stimuli. Importantly, our model (i) affords a concise analytic form, (ii) qualitatively explains the effects of transition network structure on human expectations, and (iii) quantitatively predicts human reaction times in probabilistic sequential motor tasks.

article,Lynn2020NP,"Humans communicate using systems of interconnected stimuli or concepts---from language and music to literature and science---yet it remains unclear how, if at all, the structure of these networks supports the communication of information. Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient ways that humans process this information. Here, we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system's network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly connected modules---the two defining features of hierarchical organization.

Here, we report a robust hippocampal representation of sequence memories, highlighted by ``time cells'' that encode successive moments during an empty temporal gap between the key events, while also encoding location and ongoing behavior. Furthermore, just as most place cells ``remap'' when a salient spatial cue is altered, most time cells form qualitatively different representations (``retime'') when the main temporal parameter is altered. Hippocampal neurons also differentially encode the key events and disambiguate different event sequences to compose unique, temporally organized representations of specific experiences.

article,Mack2020NC,"Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to support the ability to focus on goal-relevant information by filtering out irrelevant information, a process akin to dimensionality reduction. Here, we test this dimensionality reduction hypothesis by relating a data-driven approach to characterizing the complexity of neural representation with a theoretically-supported computational model of learning.

But it is unclear how such learning is related to the prefrontal cortex's role in short-term memory. Here we ask if the encoding of short-term memory in prefrontal cortex is used by rats learning decision rules in a Y-maze task. We find that a similar pattern of neural ensemble activity is selectively recalled after reinforcement for a correct decision. This reinforcement-selective recall only reliably occurs immediately before the abrupt behavioural transitions indicating successful learning of the current rule, and fades quickly thereafter. We could simultaneously decode multiple, retrospective task events from the ensemble activity, suggesting the recalled ensemble activity has multiplexed encoding of prior events.

Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills.

article,Manoach2019ARCP,"There is overwhelming evidence that sleep is crucial for memory consolidation. Patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected relatives have a specific deficit in sleep spindles, a defining oscillation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) Stage 2 sleep that, in coordination with other NREM oscillations, mediate memory consolidation. In schizophrenia, the spindle deficit correlates with impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation, positive symptoms, and abnormal thalamocortical connectivity. These relations point to dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which generates spindles, gates the relay of sensory information to the cortex, and modulates thalamocortical communication. Genetic studies are beginning to provide clues to possible neurodevelopmental origins of TRN-mediated thalamocortical circuit dysfunction and to identify novel targets for treating the related memory deficits and symptoms. By forging empirical links in causal chains from risk genes to thalamocortical circuit dysfunction, spindle deficits, memory impairment, symptoms, and diagnosis, future research can advance our mechanistic understanding, treatment, and prevention of schizophrenia.",,,,,,,,,"Manoach, Dara S. and Stickgold, Robert",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAdLi4vcGFwZXJzL21hbm9hY2gyMDE5YXJjcC5wZGZPEQF2AAAAAAF2AAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8TbWFub2FjaDIwMTlhcmNwLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAEIvOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOm1hbm9hY2gyMDE5YXJjcC5wZGYADgAoABMAbQBhAG4AbwBhAGMAaAAyADAAMQA5AGEAcgBjAHAALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgBAVXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvbWFub2FjaDIwMTlhcmNwLnBkZgATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABEAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb4=,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 19:00:09 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050718-095754,,,,,,,,,,,,1548-5951,,,Annual Review of Clinical Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,1,,,451--479,,,,Annual Reviews,,,,,,replay; review,,"Abnormal Sleep Spindles, Memory Consolidation, and Schizophrenia",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050718-095754,15,2019,

In particular, individual prefrontal neurons often generate remarkably complex responses that defy deep understanding of their contribution to behaviour. Here we study prefrontal cortex activity in macaque monkeys trained to flexibly select and integrate noisy sensory inputs towards a choice. We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs.

Yet, views of chickens have largely remained unrevised by this new evidence. In this paper, I examine the peer-reviewed scientific data on the leading edge of cognition, emotions, personality, and sociality in chickens, exploring such areas as self-awareness, cognitive bias, social learning and self-control, and comparing their abilities in these areas with other birds and other vertebrates, particularly mammals. My overall conclusion is that chickens are just as cognitively, emotionally and socially complex as most other birds and mammals in many areas, and that there is a need for further noninvasive comparative behavioral research with chickens as well as a re-framing of current views about their intelligence.",,,,,,,,,"Marino, Lori",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 21:14:01 +0200,2020-06-11 21:14:24 +0200,,,10.1007/s10071-016-1064-4,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-9456,,,Animal Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,2,,,127--147,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,"Thinking chickens: a review of cognition, emotion, and behavior in the domestic chicken",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-016-1064-4,20,2017,
article,Maris2007JNM,"In this paper, we show how ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) data can be analyzed statistically using nonparametric techniques. Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,"Maris, Eric and Oostenveld, Robert",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-12 18:22:33 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.03.024,,,,,,,,,,,,0165-0270,,,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,1,,,177--190,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Nonparametric statistical testing of EEG- and MEG-data,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.03.024,164,2007,

However, transferring structural knowledge to novel environments requires flexible representations that are generalizable over particularities of the current environment, such as its stimuli and size. We suggest that humans represent structural forms as abstract basis sets and that in novel tasks, the structural form is inferred and the relevant basis set is transferred. Using a computational model, we show that such representation allows inference of the underlying structural form, important task states, effective behavioural policies and the existence of unobserved state-trajectories. In two experiments, participants learned three abstract graphs during two successive days. We tested how structural knowledge acquired on Day-1 affected Day-2 performance. In line with our model, participants who had a correct structural prior were able to infer the existence of unobserved state-trajectories and appropriate behavioural policies.",,,,,,,,,"Mark, Shirley and Moran, Rani and Parr, Thomas and Kennerley, Steve W. and Behrens, Timothy E.

It is less clear how active learning impacts the integration of those experiences into flexible, generalizable knowledge. This study uses a novel active transitive inference task to investigate how people learn a relational hierarchy through active selection of premise pairs. Active control improved memory for studied premises as well as transitive inferences involving items that were never experienced together during study. Active learners also exhibited a systematic search preference, generating sequences of overlapping premises that may facilitate relational integration. Critically, however, advantages from active control were not universal: Only participants with higher working memory capacity benefited from the opportunity to select premise pairs during learning.

article,Markowetz2015GB,"And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you! Here, I present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented scientist. A complex equation on the left half of a black board, an even more complex equation on the right half. A short sentence links the two equations: ``Here a miracle occurs''. Two mathematicians in deep thought. ``I think you should be more explicit in this step'', says one to the other. This is exactly how it seems when you try to figure out how authors got from a large and complex data set to a dense paper with lots of busy figures. Without access to the data and the analysis code, a miracle occurred. And there should be no miracles in science. Working transparently and reproducibly has a lot to do with empathy: put yourself into the shoes of one of your collaboration partners and ask yourself, would that person be able to access my data and make sense of my analyses. Learning the tools of the trade (Box 1) will require commitment and a massive investment of your time and energy. A priori it is not clear why the benefits of working reproducibly outweigh its costs. Here are some reasons: because reproducibility is the right thing to do! Because it is the foundation of science! Because the world would be a better place if everyone worked transparently and reproducibly! You know how that reasoning sounds to me? Just like yaddah, yaddah, yaddah {\ldots} It's not that I think these reasons are wrong. It's just that I am not much of an idealist; I don't care how science should be. I am a realist; I try to do my best given how science actually is. And, whether you like it or not, science is all about more publications, more impact factor, more money and more career.

In dual whole-cell voltage recordings from pyramidal neurons, the coincidence of postsynaptic action potentials (APs) and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was found to induce changes in EPSPs. Their average amplitudes were differentially up- or down-regulated, depending on the precise timing of postsynaptic APs relative to EPSPs.

article,Marr1971PTRSBS,"It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex. The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation, which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about 200 out of a population of 105 cells. It is shown that if about 105 simple representations are stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the presubiculum, the prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial number of which must be true if the theory is correct.

article,Marr1970PRSLSBBS,"It is proposed that the learning of many tasks by the cerebrum is based on using a very few fundamental techniques for organizing information. It is argued that this is made possible by the prevalence in the world of a particular kind of redundancy, which is characterized by a `Fundamental Hypothesis'. This hypothesisis used to found a theory of the basic operations which, it is proposed, are carried out by the cerebral neocortex. They involve the use of past experience to form so-called `classificatory units' with which to interpret subsequent experience. Such classificatory units are imagined to be created whenever either something occurs frequently in the brain's experience, or enough redundancy appears in the form of clusters of slightly differing inputs. A(non-Bayesian) information theoretic account is given of the diagnosis of an input as an instance of an existing classificatory unit, and of the interpretation as such of an incompletely specified input. Neural models are devised to implement the two operations of diagnosis and interpretation, and it is found that the performance of the second is an automatic consequence of the model's ability to perform the first. The discovery and formation of new classificatory units is discussed within the context of these neural models. It is shown how a climbing fibre input (of the kind described by Cajal) to the correct cell can cause that cell to perform a mountain-climbing operation in an underlying probability space, that will lead it to respond to a class of events for which it is appropriate to code. This is called the `spatial recognizer effect'. The structure of the cerebral neocortex is reviewed in the light of the model which the theory establishes. It is found that many elements in the cortex have a natural identification with elements in the model. This enables many predictions, with specified degrees of firmness, to be made concerning the connexions and synapses of the following cortical cells and fibres: Martinotti cells; cerebral granule cells; pyramidal cells of layers III, V and II; short axon cells of all layers, especially I, IV and VI; cerebral climbing fibres and those cells of the cortex which give rise to them; cerebral basket cells; fusiform cells of layers VI and VII. It is shown that if rather little information about the classificatory units to be formed has been coded genetically, it may be necessary to use a technique called codon formation to organize structure in a suitable way to represent a new unit. It is shown that under certain conditions, it is necessary to carry out a part of this organization during sleep. A prediction is made about the effect of sleep on learning of a certain kind.",,,,,,,,,"Marr, David",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-31 15:28:13 +0200,2020-03-31 15:29:24 +0200,,,10.1098/rspb.1970.0040,,,,,,,,,,,,2053-9193,,,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

article,Marshall2006N,"There is compelling evidence that sleep contributes to the long-term consolidation of new memories1. This function of sleep has been linked to slow (<1 Hz) potential oscillations, which predominantly arise from the prefrontal neocortex and characterize slow wave sleep2,3,4. However, oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks, which links the membrane and synaptic processes of these neurons in time5. Whether brain potentials and their extracellular equivalent have any physiological meaning per se is unclear, but can easily be investigated by inducing the extracellular oscillating potential fields of interest6,7,8. Here we show that inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans. The slowly oscillating potential stimulation induced an immediate increase in slow wave sleep, endogenous cortical slow oscillations and slow spindle activity in the frontal cortex. Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz---another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep---decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged. Our findings indicate that endogenous slow potential oscillations have a causal role in the sleep-associated consolidation of memory, and that this role is enhanced by field effects in cortical extracellular space.",,,,,,,,,"Marshall, Lisa and Helgad{\'o}ttir, Halla and M{\""o}lle, Matthias and Born, Jan",,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,,,,,,,,,2006/11/01,,2021-01-20 15:19:53 +0100,2021-01-20 15:20:15 +0100,,,10.1038/nature05278,,,,,,,,,Marshall2006,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7119,,,610--613,,,,,,,,,,,,Boosting slow oscillations during sleep potentiates memory,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05278,444,2006,

We addressed this issue by comparing the neural pattern similarities among object-evoked fMRI responses with behavior-based models that independently captured the visual and conceptual similarities among these stimuli. Our results revealed evidence for distinctive coding of visual features in lateral occipital cortex, and conceptual features in the temporal pole and parahippocampal cortex. By contrast, we found evidence for integrative coding of visual and conceptual object features in perirhinal cortex. The neuroanatomical specificity of this effect was highlighted by results from a searchlight analysis.

Here, we present an overview of these issues, specifically focusing on the sharing of so-called ""long tail"" data, that is, data generated by individual laboratories as part of largely hypothesis-driven research. We draw on experiences in other domains to discuss attitudes toward data sharing, cost-benefits, best practices and infrastructure. We argue that the publishing of data sets is an integral component of 21st-century scholarship. Moreover, although not all issues around how and what to share have been resolved, a consensus on principles and best practices for effective data sharing and the infrastructure for sharing many types of data are largely in place.",,,,,,,,,"Martone, Maryann E. and Garcia-Castro, Alexander and VandenBos, Gary R.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 16:00:47 +0200,2020-06-11 16:02:19 +0200,,,10.1037/amp0000242,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-066X,,,American Psychologist,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,2,,,111--125,,,,American Psychological Association (APA),,,,,,,,Data sharing in psychology,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000242,73,2018,
article,Masse2018PNAS,"Artificial neural networks can suffer from catastrophic forgetting, in which learning a new task causes the network to forget how to perform previous tasks. While previous studies have proposed various methods that can alleviate forgetting over small numbers (⩽10) of tasks, it is uncertain whether they can prevent forgetting across larger numbers of tasks. In this study, we propose a neuroscience-inspired scheme, called {\textquotedblleft}context-dependent gating,{\textquotedblright} in which mostly nonoverlapping sets of units are active for any one task. Importantly, context-dependent gating has a straightforward implementation, requires little extra computational overhead, and when combined with previous methods to stabilize connection weights, can allow networks to maintain high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks.Humans and most animals can learn new tasks without forgetting old ones. However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically causes them to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of {\textquotedblleft}catastrophic forgetting,{\textquotedblright} in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance. Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: adding a context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly nonoverlapping patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks, particularly when combined with weight stabilization. We show that this method works for both feedforward and recurrent network architectures, trained using either supervised or reinforcement-based learning. This suggests that using multiple, complementary methods, akin to what is believed to occur in the brain, can be a highly effective strategy to support continual learning.",,,,,,,,,"Masse, Nicolas Y. and Grant, Gregory D. and Freedman, David J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 14:30:10 +0100,2020-10-29 14:30:42 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1803839115,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/E10467.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44,,,E10467--E10475,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Alleviating catastrophic forgetting using context-dependent gating and synaptic stabilization,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/E10467,115,2018,
article,Mattar2018NN,"To make decisions, animals must evaluate candidate choices by accessing memories of relevant experiences. Yet little is known about which experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs choice. We propose a normative theory predicting which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. Using nonlocal `replay' of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task in which an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices versus the gain from propagating newly encountered information to preceding locations. Our theory offers a simple explanation for numerous findings about place cells; unifies seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning, and consolidation; and posits a mechanism whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.",,,,,,,,,"Mattar, Marcelo G. and Daw, Nathaniel D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-01 12:09:59 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/s41593-018-0232-z,,,,,,,,,,,,1546-1726,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,11,,,1609--1617,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,replay; modeling,,Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0232-z,21,2018,

Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers & Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.",,,,,,,,,"Matuschek, Hannes and Kliegl, Reinhold and Vasishth, Shravan and Baayen, Harald and Bates, Douglas",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-01 15:26:43 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.jml.2017.01.001,,,,,,,,,,,,0749-596X,,,Journal of Memory and Language,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,305--315,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Balancing Type I error and power in linear mixed models,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2017.01.001,94,2017,

By combining functional brain imaging and region-specific neuronal inactivation in mice, we identified prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex as critical for storage and retrieval of remote spatial memories. Imaging of activity-dependent genes also revealed an involvement of parietal and retrosplenial cortices during consolidation of remote memory. Long-term memory storage within some of these neocortical regions was accompanied by structural changes including synaptogenesis and laminar reorganization, concomitant with a functional disengagement of the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortices.

article,McClelland1995PR,"Damage to the hippocampal system disrupts recent memory but leaves remote memory intact. The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.",,,,,,,,,"McClelland, James L. and McNaughton, Bruce L. and O'Reilly, Randall C.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-19 16:25:17 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.419,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-295X,,,Psychological Review,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,3,,,419--457,,,,American Psychological Association (APA),,,,,,replay,,Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: Insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory.,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.102.3.419,102,1995,
article,McCloskey1989PLM,"Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks.",,,,,,,,,"McCloskey, Michael and Cohen, Neal J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 14:48:23 +0200,2020-04-15 14:48:53 +0200,,,10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60536-8,,,,,,,,,,,9780125433242,0079-7421,,,Psychology of Learning and Motivation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,109--165,,,,Elsevier,,,,,,,,Catastrophic Interference in Connectionist Networks: The Sequential Learning Problem,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60536-8,24,1989,
article,McDevitt2015NLM,"Classical human memory studies investigating the acquisition of temporally-linked events have found that the memories for two events will interfere with each other and cause forgetting (i.e., interference; Wixted, 2004). Importantly, sleep helps consolidate memories and protect them from subsequent interference (Ellenbogen, Hulbert, Stickgold, Dinges, \& Thompson-Schill, 2006). We asked whether sleep can also repair memories that have already been damaged by interference. Using a perceptual learning paradigm, we induced interference either before or after a consolidation period. We varied brain states during consolidation by comparing active wake, quiet wake, and naps with either non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), or both NREM and REM sleep. When interference occurred after consolidation, sleep and wake both produced learning. However, interference prior to consolidation impaired memory, with retroactive interference showing more disruption than proactive interference. Sleep rescued learning damaged by interference. Critically, only naps that contained REM sleep were able to rescue learning that was highly disrupted by retroactive interference. Furthermore, the magnitude of rescued learning was correlated with the amount of REM sleep. We demonstrate the first evidence of a process by which the brain can rescue and consolidate memories damaged by interference, and that this process requires REM sleep. We explain these results within a theoretical model that considers how interference during encoding interacts with consolidation processes to predict which memories are retained or lost.",,,,,,,,,"McDevitt, Elizabeth A. and Duggan, Katherine A. and Mednick, Sara C.",,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,,,,,REM Sleep and Memory,,,,2015/07/01/,,2020-10-26 16:14:28 +0100,2020-10-26 16:14:49 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2014.11.015,,,,,,,,,,,1074-7427,,,,Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,,,Interference; REM sleep; Perceptual learning; Plasticity; Napping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51--62,,,,,,,,,,,,REM sleep rescues learning from interference,JOUR,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742714002135,122,2015,

We have also found a striking deficit in the coordinated firing of pairs of neurons tuned to similar spatial locations. Pairs have uncorrelated firing even if their fields overlap.

article,McIntosh1998JN,"Large-scale neural interactions were characterized in human subjects as they learned that an auditory stimulus signaled a visual event. Once learned, activation of left dorsal occipital cortex (increased regional cerebral blood flow) was observed when the auditory stimulus was presented alone. Partial least-squares analysis of the interregional correlations (functional connectivity) between the occipital area and the rest of the brain identified a pattern of covariation with four dominant brain areas that could have mediated this activation: prefrontal cortex (near Brodmann area 10, A10), premotor cortex (A6), superior temporal cortex (A41/42), and contralateral occipital cortex (A18). Interactions among these regions and the occipital area were quantified with structural equation modeling to identify the strongest sources of the effect on left occipital activity (effective connectivity). Learning-related changes in feedback effects from A10 and A41/42 appeared to account for this change in occipital activity. Influences from these areas on the occipital area were initially suppressive, or negative, becoming facilitory, or positive, as the association between the auditory and visual stimuli was acquired. Evaluating the total effects within the functional models showed positive influences throughout the network, suggesting enhanced interactions may have primed the system for the now-expected visual discrimination. By characterizing both changes in activity and the interactions underlying sensory associative learning, we demonstrated how parts of the nervous system operate as a cohesive network in learning about and responding to the environment.",,,,,,,,,"McIntosh, A.

article,McKenzie2019B,"Neuronal circuits face a fundamental tension between maintaining existing structure and changing to accommodate new information. Memory models often emphasize the need to encode novel patterns of neural activity imposed by {\textquotedblleft}bottom-up{\textquotedblright} sensory drive. In such models, learning is achieved through synaptic alterations, a process which potentially interferes with previously stored knowledge 1-3. Alternatively, neuronal circuits generate and maintain a preconfigured stable dynamic, sometimes referred to as an attractor, manifold, or schema 4-7, with a large reservoir of patterns available for matching with novel experiences 8-13. Here, we show that incorporation of arbitrary signals is constrained by pre-existing circuit dynamics. We optogenetically stimulated small groups of hippocampal neurons as mice traversed a chosen segment of a linear track, mimicking the emergence of place fields 1,14,15, while simultaneously recording the activity of stimulated and non-stimulated neighboring cells. Stimulation of principal neurons in CA1, but less so CA3 or the dentate gyrus, induced persistent place field remapping. Novel place fields emerged in both stimulated and non-stimulated neurons, which could be predicted from sporadic firing in the new place field location and the temporal relationship to peer neurons prior to the optogenetic perturbation. Circuit modification was reflected by altered spike transmission between connected pyramidal cell {\textendash} inhibitory interneuron pairs, which persisted during post-experience sleep. We hypothesize that optogenetic perturbation unmasked sub-threshold, pre-existing place fields16,17.

article,McKenzie2013JN,"According to schema theory as proposed by Piaget and Bartlett, learning involves the assimilation of new memories into networks of preexisting knowledge, as well as alteration of the original networks to accommodate the new information. Recent evidence has shown that rats form a schema of goal locations and that the hippocampus plays an essential role in adding new memories to the spatial schema. Here we examined the nature of hippocampal contributions to schema updating by monitoring firing patterns of multiple CA1 neurons as rats learned new goal locations in an environment in which there already were multiple goals. Before new learning, many neurons that fired on arrival at one goal location also fired at other goals, whereas ensemble activity patterns also distinguished different goal events, thus constituting a neural representation that linked distinct goals within a spatial schema. During new learning, some neurons began to fire as animals approached the new goals. These were primarily the same neurons that fired at original goals, the activity patterns at new goals were similar to those associated with the original goals, and new learning also produced changes in the preexisting goal-related firing patterns. After learning, activity patterns associated with the new and original goals gradually diverged, such that initial generalization was followed by a prolonged period in which new memories became distinguished within the ensemble representation. These findings support the view that consolidation involves assimilation of new memories into preexisting neural networks that accommodate relationships among new and existing memories.",,,,,,,,,"McKenzie, Sam and Robinson, Nick T.

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%.

article,McNaughton1987TN,"The hypothesis that the physical substrate of memory in the mammalian brain resides in alterations of synaptic efficacy has been proposed frequently in both neuroscience1--5 and cognitive science6--12, and has been widely investigated in behavioural, physiological and theoretical studies. Although this hypothesis remains unproven, considerable evidence suggests that a particular form of synaptic strengthening, induced by electrical stimulation of certain CNS fibre systems, may represent the activation of mechanisms that normally subserve associative memory. This phenomenon is known as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term enhancement (LTE)∗. It has been most intensively investigated within the hippocampal formation, a brain structure that plays a crucial role in certain forms of associative memory. Physiological investigation has revealed that LTE exhibits most of the properties implicit in Hebb's original suggestion that associative memory results from a synaptic strengthening that is contingent upon the conjunction of activity in pre- and post-synaptic elements. In this article, we outline a simple neuronal model capable of superimposing multiple memory traces within the same matrix of connections, and consider the correspondence between such models and the properties of LTE in the context of the hippocampal circuitry in which it occurs. Certain predictions are derived from this framework concerning the behavioural consequences of experimental manipulation of LTE, and we conclude by describing experimental evidence that confirms these predictions and suggests that LTE is, in fact, fundamentally involved in memory.",,,,,,,,,"McNaughton, B.L. and Morris, R.G.M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-18 10:16:47 +0100,2020-12-18 10:17:10 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-2236(87)90011-7,,,,,,,,,,,,0166-2236,,,Trends in Neurosciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,408 - 415,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampal synaptic enhancement and information storage within a distributed memory system,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166223687900117,10,1987,

The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal.

We suggest that these two kinds of consolidation, which are ordinarily treated separately, overlap in time and jointly benefit from a period of reduced interference (during which no new memories are formed). Conditions that result in reduced interference include slow wave sleep (SWS), NMDA receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, alcohol and acetylcholine antagonists.

Because of the methodological difficulties in modulating sleep, however, a causal link between specific sleep features and human memory consolidation is lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated specific sleep features during a daytime nap via direct pharmacological intervention. Using zolpidem (Ambien), a short-acting GABAA agonist hypnotic, we show increased sleep spindle density and decreased REM sleep compared with placebo and sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Naps with increased spindles produced significantly better verbal memory and significantly worse perceptual learning but did not affect motor learning. The experimental spindles were similar to control spindles in amplitude and frequency, suggesting that the experimental intervention enhanced normal sleep processes.

First, a majority of hippocampal receptive fields on linear tracks are negatively skewed, such that during a single pass the firing rate is low as the rat enters the field but high as it exits. Second, while the place fields are symmetric at the beginning of a session, they become highly asymmetric with experience. Further experiments suggest that these results are likely to arise due to synaptic plasticity during behavior.

We examined a number of parameters that characterize the fMRI response and determined that its onset time is best defined by the inflection point from the resting baseline.

article,Menon1999TCS,"A large body of research in human perception and cognition has been concerned with the segregation of mental events into their presumed hierarchical processing stages, the temporal aspect of such processing being termed `mental chronometry'. Advances in single-event functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have allowed the extraction of relative timing information between the onset of activity in different neural substrates as well as the duration of cognitive processing during a task, offering new opportunities in the study of human perception and cognition. Single-event fMRI studies have also facilitated increased spatial resolution in fMRI, allowing studies of columnar organization in humans. Important processes such as object recognition, binocular vision and other processes are thought to be organized at the columnar level; thus, these advances in the spatial and temporal capabilities of fMRI allow a new generation of cognitive and basic neuroscience studies to be performed, investigating the temporal and spatial relationships between these cortical sub-units. Such experiments bear a closer resemblance to single-unit or evoked-potential studies than to classical static brain activation maps and might serve as a bridge between primate electrophysiology and human studies.

The rapid growth in adoption of LMMs has been matched by a proliferation of differences in practice. Unless this diversity is recognized, and checked, the field shall reap enormous difficulties in the future when attempts are made to consolidate or synthesize research findings. Here we examine this diversity using two methods -- a survey of researchers (n = 163) and a quasi-systematic review of papers using LMMs (n = 400). The survey reveals substantive concerns among psychologists using or planning to use LMMs and an absence of agreed standards. The review of papers complements the survey, showing variation in how the models are built, how effects are evaluated and, most worryingly, how models are reported. Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors' intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,"Meteyard, Lotte and Davies, Robert A.I.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-30 15:06:33 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1016/j.jml.2020.104092,,,,,,,,,,,,0749-596X,,,Journal of Memory and Language,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,104092,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,methods; stats,,Best practice guidance for linear mixed-effects models in psychological science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2020.104092,112,2020,
article,Meyberg2015N,"Covert shifts of visuospatial attention are traditionally assumed to occur in the absence of oculomotor behavior. In contrast, recent behavioral studies have linked attentional cueing effects to the occurrence of microsaccades, small eye movements executed involuntarily during attempted fixation. Here we used a new type of electrophysiological marker to explore the attention--microsaccade relationship, the visual brain activity evoked by the microsaccade itself. By shifting the retinal image, microsaccades frequently elicit neural responses throughout the visual pathway, scalp-recordable in the human EEG as a microsaccade-related potential (mSRP). Although mSRPs contain similar signal components (P1/N1) as traditional visually-evoked potentials (VEPs), it is unknown whether they are also influenced by cognition. Based on established findings that VEPs are amplified for visual inputs at currently attended locations, we expected a selective gain-modulation also for mSRPs. Eye movements and EEG were coregistered in a classic spatial cueing task with an endogenous cue. Replicating behavioral findings, the direction of early microsaccades 200--400 ms after cue onset was biased towards the cued side. However, for microsaccades throughout the cue-target interval, mSRPs were systematically enhanced at occipital scalp sites contralateral to the cued hemifield. This attention effect resembled that in a control condition with VEPs and did not interact with the direction of the underlying microsaccade, suggesting that mSRPs reflect the focus of sustained visuospatial attention, which remains fixed at the cued location, despite microsaccades. Microsaccades are not merely an artifact source in the EEG; instead, they are followed by cognitively modulated brain potentials that can serve as non-intrusive electrophysiological probes of attention.",,,,,,,,,"Meyberg, Susann and Werkle-Bergner, Markus and Sommer, Werner and Dimigen, Olaf",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-03 10:11:06 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.09.065,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,,,,79--88,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Microsaccade-related brain potentials signal the focus of visuospatial attention,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.09.065,104,2015,
article,Meyer-Mueller2020BBR,"When facing a choice at a decision point in a maze, rats often display hesitations, pauses and reorientations. Such ""vicarious trial and error"" (VTE) behavior is thought to reflect decision making about which choice option is best, and thus a deliberation process. Although deliberation relies on a wide neural network, the dorsal hippocampus appears to play a prominent role through both its neural activity and its dynamic interplay with other brain areas. In contrast, the involvement of the ventral hippocampus in deliberation is unexplored. Here, we compared directly the effects of dorsal (dHPC) and ventral intermediate (vHPC) hippocampal inactivations induced by intracerebral muscimol injections on VTE behavior as a model of deliberation. To this aim, we analyzed VTE events as rats were required to switch strategy to a new unlearned reward rule. We used a protocol in which task performance in muscimol-injected animals was minimally altered so as to evidence specific effects on VTE behavior. Our results show subtle alterations in VTE behavior following dHPC, but not vHPC, inactivations, therefore suggesting a specific contribution of the dorsal hippocampus to deliberation through its role in prospective evaluation of future actions.",,,,,,,,,"Meyer-Mueller, Cameron and Jacob, Pierre-Yves and Montenay, Jean-Yves and Poitreau, Julien and Poucet, Bruno and Chaillan, Franck A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 11:42:12 +0200,2020-06-11 11:43:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112622,,,,,,,,,,,,0166-4328,,,Behavioural Brain Research,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,112622,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,"Dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal inactivation alters deliberation in rats",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112622,390,2020,

However, little is known about the mechanisms that guide such a temporally structured replay in humans, because previous studies used either unsuitable methods or paradigms to address this question. Here, we overcome these limitations by developing a new analysis method to detect the replay of temporal patterns in a paradigm that requires participants to mentally replay short sound or video clips. We show that memory reinstatement is accompanied by a decrease of low-frequency (8 Hz) power, which carries a temporal phase signature of the replayed stimulus. These replay effects were evident in the visual as well as in the auditory domain and were localized to sensory-specific regions.

article,Michelmann2018JCN,"Forming a memory often entails the association of recent experience with present events. This recent experience is usually an information-rich and dynamic representation of the world around us. We here show that associating a static cue with a previously shown dynamic stimulus yields a detectable, dynamic representation of this stimulus. We further implicate this representation in the decrease of low-frequency power (∼4--30 Hz) in the ongoing EEG, which is a well-known correlate of successful memory formation. The reappearance of content-specific patterns in desynchronizing brain oscillations was observed in two sensory domains, that is, in a visual condition and in an auditory condition. Together with previous results, these data suggest a mechanism that generalizes across domains and processes, in which the decrease in oscillatory power allows for the dynamic representation of information in ongoing brain oscillations.",,,,,,,,,"Michelmann, Sebastian and Bowman, Howard and Hanslmayr, Simon",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-27 11:02:24 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1162/jocn_a_01304,,,,,,,,,,,,1530-8898,,,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,11,,,1577--1589,,,,MIT Press - Journals,,,,,,,,Replay of Stimulus-specific Temporal Patterns during Associative Memory Formation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01304,30,2018,

Here we investigate such learning as it naturally occurs during story listening, with the goal of uncovering when and how memories are stored and retrieved during processing of continuous, naturalistic stimuli. In behavioral experiments we confirm that, after a single exposure to a naturalistic story, participants can learn about its structure and are able to recall upcoming words in the story. In patients undergoing electrocorticographic recordings, we then track mnemonic information in high frequency activity (70 {\textendash} 200Hz) as patients listen to a story twice. In auditory processing regions we demonstrate the rapid reinstatement of upcoming information after a single exposure; this neural measure of predictive recall correlates with behavioral measures of event segmentation and learning. Connectivity analyses on the neural data reveal information-flow from cortex to hippocampus at the end of events.

In behavioural and magnetoencephalography data, we show that memory replay is temporally compressed and proceeds in a forward direction. Neural replay is characterized by the reinstatement of temporal patterns from encoding. These fragments of activity reappear on a compressed timescale.

Here, we monitored the trial-to-trial changes in hippocampal place cell activity during the acquisition of place-reward associations with varying reward size. We show a faster reorganization and stabilization of the hippocampal place map when a goal location is associated with a large reward. The reorganization is driven by both rate changes and the appearance and disappearance of place fields. The occurrence of hippocampal replay activity largely followed the dynamics of changes in spatial representations.

phdthesis,Michon2019L,"We do not remember all our experiences equally long nor equally vividly. It appears intuitive, and has been experimentally demonstrated, that more salient and relevant experiences are preferentially remembered for a longer period of time. However, the mechanisms underlying the selective retention of memories are still under active investigation. Cognitive functions are thought to be supported by the coordinated activity of neuronal populations distributed in different brain regions. The formation of memory and its transfer into a long-lasting state, known as memory consolidation, engages the interaction between neuronal ensembles in the cortex and the hippocampus. The spatio-temporal context of an experience is associated with a unique pattern of neuronal activity in the population of hippocampal neurons. During periods of quiet wakefulness or during sleep, the activity patterns observed during experience are reactivated. Such replay occurs at a faster time scale than during experience and co-occur with fast oscillations measured in the local field potential called sharp wave ripples (SWRs). Each single replay event in the hippocampus relates to the context of one particular past experience and thereby could specifically support the consolidation of the associated memory. Thus, it is also conceivable that the most relevant experiences are preferentially replayed during sleep, leading to selectively enhanced consolidation of the associated memory. Rats trained to associate two contextually distinct locations with different amounts of reward, showed stronger memory for the location associated with the larger reward after a delay. The effect appeared to be strongest for locations demanding the highest level of spatial integration. The reward-related enhancement of memory was accompanied by increased replay activity of the highly rewarded context, an effect that was more prevalent for locations requiring higher spatial integration, and it was specifically sensitive to disruption of all replay events during the delay after learning. These results demonstrate a causal link between the increased occurrences of replays during sleep and the selective enhancement of memory consolidation for highly rewarded experiences. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation and consolidation of memory will require the simultaneous recordings of population of neurons in the different brain regions involved. The technologies used today, wire electrodes loaded into micro-drive arrays and electrode-dense silicone probes respectively lack the number of electrodes or their flexible and accurate positioning to perform such recordings. Newly engineered flexible silicone probes enabled to combine the advantages of the two approaches, allowing to load a micro-drive array with up to 16 independently movable silicon probes. The use of the device was demonstrated by performing simultaneous chronic recordings of populations of cells in the cortex and the hippocampus. This prototype offers an alternative solution towards large scale recordings of distributed neuronal ensembles.

Offline replay of hippocampal neural patterns supports the acquisition of new tasks in novel contexts, but its contribution to consolidation of salient experiences in a familiar context is unknown. Here, we show that in a highly familiar spatial memory task, large rewards selectively enhanced performance for demanding task configurations. The reward-related enhancement was sensitive to ripple-specific disruption, and the proportion of replay events positively correlated with reward size and task demands. Hippocampal replay thus selectively enhances memory of highly rewarded locations in a familiar context.",,,,,,,,,"Michon, Fr{\'e}d{\'e}ric and Sun, Jyh-Jang and Kim, Chae Young and Ciliberti, Davide and Kloosterman, Fabian",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAaLi4vcGFwZXJzL21pY2hvbjIwMTljYi5wZGZPEQFsAAAAAAFsAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8QbWljaG9uMjAxOWNiLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAD8vOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOm1pY2hvbjIwMTljYi5wZGYAAA4AIgAQAG0AaQBjAGgAbwBuADIAMAAxADkAYwBiAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPVVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL21pY2hvbjIwMTljYi5wZGYAABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEEAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABsQ==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 16:37:38 +0100,2020-12-14 16:37:58 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.03.048,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,"behavior, consolidation, hippocampus, memory, replay, rats, reward, sharp wave ripples",,,,,,,,,,,9,,,1436 - 1444.e5,,,,,,,,,,,,Post-learning Hippocampal Replay Selectively Reinforces Spatial Memory for Highly Rewarded Locations,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221930346X,29,2019,

In this review, we pinpoint the possible psychological and neural mechanisms by which reward promotes learning, from guiding attention to enhancing memory consolidation. We then discuss how reward value can spill-over from one conditioned stimulus to a non-conditioned stimulus. Such generalization can occur across perceptually similar items or through more complex relations, such as associative or logical inferences. Existing evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter dopamine boosts the formation of declarative memory for rewarded information and may also control the generalization of reward values. In particular, temporally-correlated activity in the hippocampus and in regions of the dopaminergic circuit may mediate value-based decisions and facilitate cross-item integration.

article,Miezin2000N,"Rapid-presentation event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI) allows neuroimaging methods based on hemodynamics to employ behavioral task paradigms typical of cognitive settings. However, the sluggishness of the hemodynamic response and its variance provide constraints on how ER-fMRI can be applied. In a series of two studies, estimates of the hemodynamic response in or near the primary visual and motor cortices were compared across various paradigms and sampling procedures to determine the limits of ER-fMRI procedures and, more generally, to describe the behavior of the hemodynamic response. The temporal profile of the hemodynamic response was estimated across overlapping events by solving a set of linear equations within the general linear model. No assumptions about the shape were made in solving the equations. Following estimation of the temporal profile, the amplitude and timing were modeled using a γ function. Results indicated that (1) within a region, for a given subject, estimation of the hemodynamic response is extremely stable for both amplitude (r2 = 0.98) and time to peak (r2 = 0.95), from one series of measurements to the next, and slightly less stable for estimation of time to onset (r2 = 0.60). (2) As the trial presentation rate changed (from those spaced 20 s apart to temporally overlapping trials), the hemodynamic response amplitude showed a small, but significant, decrease. Trial onsets spaced (on average) 5 s apart showed a 17--25% reduction in amplitude compared to those spaced 20 s apart. Power analysis indicated that the increased number of trials at fast rates outweighs this decrease in amplitude if statistically reliable response detection is the goal.

article,Miller2020B,"Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition.

article,Minxha2020S,"Flexibly switching between different tasks is a fundamental human cognitive ability that allows us to make selective use of only the information needed for a given decision. Minxha et al. used single-neuron recordings from patients to understand how the human brain retrieves memories on demand when needed for making a decision and how retrieved memories are dynamically routed in the brain from the temporal to the frontal lobe. When memory was not needed, only medial frontal cortex neural activity was correlated with the task. However, when outcome choices required memory retrieval, frontal cortex neurons were phase-locked to field potentials recorded in the medial temporal lobe. Therefore, depending on demands of the task, neurons in different regions can flexibly engage and disengage their activity patterns.Science, this issue p. eaba3313INTRODUCTIONDecision-making in complex environments relies on flexibly combining stimulus representations with context, goals, and memories. A central component of cognitive flexibility is to selectively retrieve information from memory and utilize the retrieved information to make decisions. The medial frontal cortex (MFC) plays a critical role in this process by representing task sets, context, and outcomes. During decision-making, the MFC is thought to selectively engage memory retrieval by representing memory-based choices and mediating interactions between the frontal lobes and the hippocampus and amygdala (HA) through phase-locking of MFC activity to oscillations in the HA. It remains unknown what features of decisions and context are represented in the human MFC and what functional interactions between the MFC and HA mediate dynamic memory retrieval during a task.RATIONALEWe recorded single neurons and local field potentials in the human MFC and HA in patients implanted with depth electrodes. Subjects switched between two tasks: recognition memory and categorization. To identify signatures of task demands, we compared the strength of encoding of stimulus familiarity, category, and choices between tasks and tested whether decoders trained in one task generalized to the other task. Such cross-task generalizability would indicate abstract representations of the underlying variables. We hypothesized that this approach would reveal neural signatures of the representations and functional interactions that permit memory-based decisions.RESULTSWe recorded from 1430 single neurons in the HA and MFC [dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)] across 13 patients. Subjects made {\textquotedblleft}yes{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}no{\textquotedblright} decisions using button presses or saccades (eye movements) to indicate whether an image was novel or familiar, or whether an image belonged to a given visual category. Instructions were given before each block of trials, explaining the task and response modality to use (i.e., task set). Examining the underlying neural representations at the single-neuron and population levels revealed the following: (i) Cells in the MFC represented task set during baseline periods. These contextual signals emerged rapidly after a task switch and generalized across all response and task-type combinations in the MFC but not the HA. (ii) The strength and geometry of representations of familiarity were task-insensitive in the HA but not in the MFC. The responses of these memory-selective cells were a reflection of memory strength rather than decisions about the memory. (iii) The visual category of stimuli was represented more strongly during the memory task in both the MFC and HA. This encoding of category generalized across tasks fully in the HA but not the MFC. (iv) Choices in both tasks were most strongly represented by cells in the MFC. This choice representation differed in its population-level geometry between the two tasks but was insensitive to response modality (button press or saccade). One subset of MFC cells signaled only memory-based choices, and these cells signaled decisions about the memory. (v) MFC cells phase-locked their activity to theta-frequency band oscillation in the HA preferentially in the memory task, with memory-choice cells also phase-locking in the gamma-frequency band. The strength of this interareal phase-locking in both frequency bands of the MFC cells that signaled memory-based choices was predictive of behavior.CONCLUSIONWe leveraged the opportunity to record from single neurons in humans to identify representations of choices, task sets, stimulus category, and familiarity in the human MFC and HA. We found that neuronal populations within the MFC formed two separate decision axes: one for memory-based decisions and another for categorization-based decisions. MFC-HA theta-frequency functional connectivity was selectively enhanced during memory retrieval. This work reveals a neuronal mechanism in the human brain whereby oscillation-mediated coordination of activity between distant brain regions and accompanying changes in strength of representation and/or geometry implements task-dependent retrieval of memory.Flexible representations of choices in the human frontal lobe.(A) Recording locations. LFP, local field potential. (B) Population response of all recorded neurons (left) and example of a cell signaling memory-based choices (right). (C and D) Representational geometry analysis reveals that different subspaces are used by the two tasks, establishing a memory-specific decision axis. (E) Theta- and gamma-band coherence of MFC choice cells with HA LFPs increased during the memory task.Decision-making in complex environments relies on flexibly using prior experience. This process depends on the medial frontal cortex (MFC) and the medial temporal lobe, but it remains unknown how these structures implement selective memory retrieval. We recorded single neurons in the MFC, amygdala, and hippocampus while human subjects switched between making recognition memory{\textendash}based and categorization-based decisions. The MFC rapidly implemented changing task demands by using different subspaces of neural activity and by representing the currently relevant task goal. Choices requiring memory retrieval selectively engaged phase-locking of MFC neurons to amygdala and hippocampus field potentials, thereby enabling the routing of memories. These findings reveal a mechanism for flexibly and selectively engaging memory retrieval and show that memory-based choices are preferentially represented in the frontal cortex when required.",,,,,,,,,"Minxha, Juri and Adolphs, Ralph and Fusi, Stefano and Mamelak, Adam N. and Rutishauser, Ueli",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 14:05:07 +0100,2021-01-18 14:05:40 +0100,,,10.1126/science.aba3313,,,,,eaba3313,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/eaba3313.full.pdf,,,,,,0036-8075,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6498,,,,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,,,Flexible recruitment of memory-based choice representations by the human medial frontal cortex,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/eaba3313,368,2020,

article,Misaki2013JNM,"We examined how spatial smoothing affects the result of multivariate classification analysis using the linear support vector machine (SVM) for decoding columnar-level organization. It has been suggested that the effect of spatial smoothing on decoding performance is minor because smoothing operation is an invertible data transformation and such invertible transformation does not remove information in multivariate pattern. Our theoretical consideration, however, revealed that generalization score (performance for test samples unused during classifier training) was susceptible to non-uniform scaling of input data; SVM classifier became less sensitive to variability in shrunk dimension. This result indicates that spatial smoothing reduces sensitivity of SVM classifier to high spatial frequency pattern so that the effect of smoothing implies the amount of information distributed in spatial frequencies. We also examined the effect of smoothing in an fMRI experiment of decoding ocular dominance responses. The results of group statistic showed that large smoothing reduced decoding accuracies while the smoothing effect at individual subject were not the same for all subjects. These results suggest that spatial smoothing can have major effect on decoding performance and the informative pattern for columnar level decoding resides in higher frequencies on average across subjects while it may distribute multiple frequencies at individual subject level.",,,,,,,,,"Misaki, Masaya and Luh, Wen-Ming and Bandettini, Peter A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 13:18:27 +0200,2020-07-20 14:46:07 +0200,,,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.11.004,,,,,,,,,,,,0165-0270,,,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,,,"Multivoxel pattern analysis, Support vector machine, Informative spatial frequency, Columnar-level decoding",,,,,,,,Jan,,,2,,,355--361,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,The effect of spatial smoothing on {fMRI} decoding of columnar-level organization with linear support vector machine,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.11.004,212,2013,
article,Misaki2013N,"We investigated the decoding of ocular dominance stimulations with millisecond-order timing difference from the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In our experiment, ocular dominance columns were activated by monocular visual stimulation with 500- or 100- ms onset differences. We observed that the event-related hemodynamic response (HDR) in the human visual cortex was sensitive to the subtle onset difference. The HDR shapes were related to the stimulus timings in various manners: the timing difference was represented in either the amplitude of positive peak, amplitude of negative peak, delay of peak time, or response duration of HDR. These complex relationships were different across voxels and subjects. To find an informative feature of HDR for discriminating the subtle timing difference of ocular dominance stimulations, we examined various characteristics of HDR including response amplitude, time to peak, full width at half-maximum response, as inputs for decoding analysis. Using a canonical HDR function for estimating the voxel's response did not yield good decoding scores, suggesting that information may reside in the variability of HDR shapes. Using all the values from the deconvolved HDR also showed low performance, which could be due to an over-fitting problem with the large data dimensionality. When using either positive or negative peak amplitude of the deconvolved HDR, high decoding performance could be achieved for both the 500ms and the 100ms onset differences. The high accuracy even for the 100ms difference, given that the signal was sampled at a TR of 250ms and 2×2×3-mm voxels, implies a possibility of spatiotemporally hyper-resolution decoding.

article,Miyashita1988N,"In human long-term memory, ideas and concepts become associated in the learning process1. No neuronal correlate for this cognitive function has so far been described, except that memory traces are thought to be localized in the cerebral cortex; the temporal lobe has been assigned as the site for visual experience because electric stimulation of this area results in imagery recall,2 and lesions produce deficits in visual recognition of objects3--9. We previously reported that in the anterior ventral temporal cortex of monkeys, individual neurons have a sustained activity that is highly selective for a few of the 100 coloured fractal patterns used in a visual working-memory task10. Here I report the development of this selectivity through repeated trials involving the working memory. The few patterns for which a neuron was conjointly selective were frequently related to each other through stimulus--stimulus association imposed during training. The results indicate that the selectivity acquired by these cells represents a neuronal correlate of the associative long-term memory of pictures.",,,,,,,,,"Miyashita, Yasushi",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-01 13:10:15 +0200,2020-04-01 13:10:44 +0200,,,10.1038/335817a0,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,6193,,,817--820,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,statistical learning,,Neuronal correlate of visual associative long-term memory in the primate temporal cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/335817a0,335,1988,

article,Mnih2015N,"The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.",,,,,,,,,"Mnih, Volodymyr and Kavukcuoglu, Koray and Silver, David and Rusu, Andrei A. and Veness, Joel and Bellemare, Marc G. and Graves, Alex and Riedmiller, Martin and Fidjeland, Andreas K. and Ostrovski, Georg and et al.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-13 10:45:17 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/nature14236,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,7540,,,529--533,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,replay; modeling,,Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14236,518,2015,

Conversely, distal threats allow increased information processing supported by model-based (MB) operations, including affective prospection, replay, and planning.

Fear conditioning caused many place cells to alter (or remap) their preferred firing locations in the training environment, whereas most cells remained stable in the control environment. This finding indicates that aversive reinforcement can induce place cell remapping even when the environment itself remains unchanged. Furthermore, contextual fear conditioning caused significantly more remapping of place cells than auditory fear conditioning, suggesting that place cell remapping was related to the rat's learned fear of the environment. These results suggest that one possible function of place cell remapping may be to generate new spatial representations of a single environment, which could help the animal to discriminate among different motivational contexts within that environment.",,,,,,,,,"Moita, M.

Rats received either paired or unpaired presentations of an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) and an electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US). Hippocampal neurons (place and theta cells) acquired responses to the auditory CS in the paired but not in the unpaired group. After CS-US pairing, rhythmic firing of theta cells became synchronized to the onset of the CS.

article,Momennejad2017NHB,"Theories of reward learning in neuroscience have focused on two families of algorithms thought to capture deliberative versus habitual choice. `Model-based' algorithms compute the value of candidate actions from scratch, whereas `model-free' algorithms make choice more efficient but less flexible by storing pre-computed action values. We examine an intermediate algorithmic family, the successor representation, which balances flexibility and efficiency by storing partially computed action values: predictions about future events. These pre-computation strategies differ in how they update their choices following changes in a task. The successor representation's reliance on stored predictions about future states predicts a unique signature of insensitivity to changes in the task's sequence of events, but flexible adjustment following changes to rewards. We provide evidence for such differential sensitivity in two behavioural studies with humans.

article,Momennejad2018B,"The successor representation (SR) is a candidate principle for generalization in reinforcement learning, computational accounts of memory, and the structure of neural representations in the hippocampus. Given a sequence of states, the SR learns a predictive representation for every given state that encodes how often, on average, each upcoming state is expected to be visited, even if it is multiple steps ahead. A discount or scale parameter determines how many steps into the future SR{\textquoteright}s generalizations reach, enabling rapid value computation, subgoal discovery, and flexible decision-making in large trees. However, SR with a single scale could discard information for predicting both the sequential order of and the distance between states, which are common problems in navigation for animals and artificial agents. Here we propose a solution: an ensemble of SRs with multiple scales. We show that the derivative of multi-scale SR can reconstruct both the sequence of expected future states and estimate distance to goal. This derivative can be computed linearly: we show that a multi-scale SR ensemble is the Laplace transform of future states, and the inverse of this Laplace transform is a biologically plausible linear estimation of the derivative. Multi-scale SR and its derivative could lead to a common principle for how the medial temporal lobe supports both map-based and vector-based navigation.",,,,,,,,,"Momennejad, Ida and Howard, Marc W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-26 08:44:14 +0100,2021-01-26 08:44:29 +0100,,,10.1101/449470,,,,,449470,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/22/449470.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Predicting the Future with Multi-scale Successor Representations,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/22/449470,,2018,
article,Momennejad2018E,"Making decisions in sequentially structured tasks requires integrating distally acquired information. The extensive computational cost of such integration challenges planning methods that integrate online, at decision time. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether `offline' integration during replay supports planning, and if so which memories should be replayed. Inspired by machine learning, we propose that (a) offline replay of trajectories facilitates integrating representations that guide decisions, and (b) unsigned prediction errors (uncertainty) trigger such integrative replay. We designed a 2-step revaluation task for fMRI, whereby participants needed to integrate changes in rewards with past knowledge to optimally replan decisions. As predicted, we found that (a) multi-voxel pattern evidence for off-task replay predicts subsequent replanning; (b) neural sensitivity to uncertainty predicts subsequent replay and replanning; (c) off-task hippocampus and anterior cingulate activity increase when revaluation is required.

However, relatively little is known about the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying memory for time. In particular, whether the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is involved in temporal processing remains an open question. During high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, participants watched a ~28-min episode of a television show. During the test, they viewed still-frames and indicated on a continuous timeline the precise time each still-frame was viewed during the study. This procedure allowed us to measure error in seconds for each trial. We analyzed fMRI data from retrieval and found that high temporal precision was associated with increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI activity in the anterolateral entorhinal (a homolog of the LEC in rodents) and perirhinal cortices, but not in the posteromedial entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices.

article,Moran2021PNAS,"Credit assignment (CA) to relevant actions poses a challenge because one is often flooded with reward feedback that is not easily causally attributed. We addressed this issue in a reinforcement learning framework wherein choice is mutually controlled by value-caching model-free (MF) and prospective, planning model-based (MB) systems. We find knowledge, stored in a cognitive map, filters exuberant reward feedback to guide CA in both systems but based on different attribute dimensions. In MF, CA is boosted for outcomes that are relevant (causally related) to one{\textquoteright}s choice, whereas in MB, CA is enhanced for outcomes that attract greater attention during the deliberation process that preceded a choice. We consider normative and mechanistic accounts, including how these processes are instrumental to adaptation.An influential reinforcement learning framework proposes that behavior is jointly governed by model-free (MF) and model-based (MB) controllers. The former learns the values of actions directly from past encounters, and the latter exploits a cognitive map of the task to calculate these prospectively. Considerable attention has been paid to how these systems interact during choice, but how and whether knowledge of a cognitive map contributes to the way MF and MB controllers assign credit (i.e., to how they revaluate actions and states following the receipt of an outcome) remains underexplored. Here, we examine such sophisticated credit assignment using a dual-outcome bandit task. We provide evidence that knowledge of a cognitive map influences credit assignment in both MF and MB systems, mediating subtly different aspects of apparent relevance. Specifically, we show MF credit assignment is enhanced for those rewards that are related to a choice, and this contrasted with choice-unrelated rewards that reinforced subsequent choices negatively. This modulation is only possible based on knowledge of task structure. On the other hand, MB credit assignment was boosted for outcomes that impacted on differences in values between offered bandits. We consider mechanistic accounts and the normative status of these findings. We suggest the findings extend the scope and sophistication of cognitive map-based credit assignment during reinforcement learning, with implications for understanding behavioral control.The data that support the findings of this study and data analysis code have been deposited in the Open Science Framework (OSF) and are available in the following link: https://osf.io/ydrv7/?view_only=c0c00083077d45e18f7997d53172150e.",,,,,,,,,"Moran, Rani and Dayan, Peter and Dolan, Raymond J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-22 16:46:45 +0100,2021-01-22 16:47:02 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.2016884118,,,,,e2016884118,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016884118.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Human subjects exploit a cognitive map for credit assignment,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016884118,118,2021,

Here, we address this problem within the framework of an interaction between model-free (MF) and model-based (MB) control systems. We present and support experimentally a theory of MB retrospective-inference. Within this framework, a MB system resolves uncertainty that prevailed when actions were taken thus guiding an MF credit-assignment. Using a task in which there was initial uncertainty about the lotteries that were chosen, we found that when participants'momentary uncertainty about which lottery had generated an outcome was resolved by provision of subsequent information, participants preferentially assigned credit within a MF system to the lottery they retrospectively inferred was responsible for this outcome.

article,Morton2020PNAS,"Prior work has shown that the brain represents memories within a cognitive map that supports inference about connections between individual related events. Real-world adaptive behavior is also supported by recognizing common structure among numerous distinct contexts; for example, based on prior experience with restaurants, when visiting a new restaurant one can expect to first get a table, then order, eat, and finally pay the bill. We used a neurocomputational approach to examine how the brain extracts and uses abstract representations of common structure to support novel decisions. Participants learned image pairs (AB, BC) drawn from distinct triads (ABC) that shared the same internal structure and were then tested on their ability to infer indirect (AC) associations. We found that hippocampal and frontoparietal regions formed abstract representations that coded cross-triad relationships with a common geometric structure. Critically, such common representational geometries were formed despite the lack of explicit reinforcement to do so. Furthermore, we found that representations in parahippocampal cortex are hierarchical, reflecting both cross-triad relationships and distinctions between triads. We propose that representations with common geometric structure provide a vector space that codes inferred item relationships with a direction vector that is consistent across triads, thus supporting faster inference. Using computational modeling of response time data, we found evidence for dissociable vector-based retrieval and pattern-completion processes that contribute to successful inference. Moreover, we found evidence that these processes are mediated by distinct regions, with pattern completion supported by hippocampus and vector-based retrieval supported by parahippocampal cortex and lateral parietal cortex.",,,,,,,,,"Morton, Neal W and Schlichting, Margaret L. and Preston, Alison R.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-24 08:58:46 +0100,2020-11-24 08:59:09 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1912338117,,,,,201912338,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/19/1912338117.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Representations of common event structure in medial temporal lobe and frontoparietal cortex support efficient inference,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/19/1912338117,,2020,

Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.",,1,,,69--89,,,,Annual Reviews,,,,,,,,"Place Cells, Grid Cells, and the Brain's Spatial Representation System",JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723,31,2008,2008

article,Muller1996JGP,"A theory of cognitive mapping is developed that depends only on accepted properties of hippocampal function, namely, long-term potentiation, the place cell phenomenon, and the associative or recurrent connections made among CA3 pyramidal cells. It is proposed that the distance between the firing fields of connected pairs of CA3 place cells is encoded as synaptic resistance (reciprocal synaptic strength). The encoding occurs because pairs of cells with coincident or overlapping fields will tend to fire together in time, thereby causing a decrease in synaptic resistance via long-term potentiation; in contrast, cells with widely separated fields will tend never to fire together, causing no change or perhaps (via long-term depression) an increase in synaptic resistance. A network whose connection pattern mimics that of CA3 and whose connection weights are proportional to synaptic resistance can be formally treated as a weighted, directed graph. In such a graph, a ""node"" is assigned to each CA3 cell and two nodes are connected by a ""directed edge"" if and only if the two corresponding cells are connected by a synapse. Weighted, directed graphs can be searched for an optimal path between any pair of nodes with standard algorithms. Here, we are interested in finding the path along which the sum of the synaptic resistances from one cell to another is minimal. Since each cell is a place cell, such a path also corresponds to a path in two-dimensional space. Our basic finding is that minimizing the sum of the synaptic resistances along a path in neural space yields the shortest (optimal) path in unobstructed two-dimensional space, so long as the connectivity of the network is great enough. In addition to being able to find geodesics in unobstructed space, the same network enables solutions to the ""detour"" and ""shortcut"" problems, in which it is necessary to find an optimal path around a newly introduced barrier and to take a shorter path through a hole opened up in a preexisting barrier, respectively. We argue that the ability to solve such problems qualifies the proposed hippocampal object as a cognitive map. Graph theory thus provides a sort of existence proof demonstrating that the hippocampus contains the necessary information to function as a map, in the sense postulated by others (O'Keefe, J., and L. Nadel. 1978. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK). It is also possible that the cognitive mapping functions of the hippocampus are carried out by parallel graph searching algorithms implemented as neural processes. This possibility has the great attraction that the hippocampus could then operate in much the same way to find paths in general problem space; it would only be necessary for pyramidal cells to exhibit a strong nonpositional firing correlate.",,,,,,,,,"Muller, R U and Stead, M and Pach, J",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL211bGxlcjE5OTZqZ3AucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EW11bGxlcjE5OTZqZ3AucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAUERGIENBUk8AAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczptdWxsZXIxOTk2amdwLnBkZgAOACQAEQBtAHUAbABsAGUAcgAxADkAOQA2AGoAZwBwAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL211bGxlcjE5OTZqZ3AucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 10:46:22 +0100,2020-10-27 10:47:07 +0100,,,10.1085/jgp.107.6.663,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of General Physiology,,,,,,,,,,,06,,,6,,,663-694,,,,,,,,,,,,The hippocampus as a cognitive graph,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.107.6.663,107,1996,
article,Muller1987JN,"A TV/computer technique was used to simultaneously track a rat{\textquoteright}s position in a simple apparatus and record the firing of single hippocampal complex-spike neurons. The primary finding is that many of these neurons behave as {\textquotedblleft}place cells,{\textquotedblright} as first described by O{\textquoteright}Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971) and O{\textquoteright}Keefe (1976). Each place cell fires rapidly only when the rat is in a delimited portion of the apparatus (the cell{\textquoteright}s {\textquotedblleft}firing field{\textquotedblright}). In agreement with O{\textquoteright}Keefe (1976) and many other authors, we have seen that the firing of place cells is highly correlated with the animal{\textquoteright}s position and is remarkably independent of other aspects of the animal{\textquoteright}s behavioral state. Several properties of firing fields were characterized. Firing fields are stable over long time intervals (days) if the environment is constant. They come in several shapes when the animal is in a cylindrical apparatus; moreover, the set of field shapes is different when the animal is in a rectangular apparatus. It also seems that a single cell may have more than one field in a given apparatus. By collecting a sample of 40 place cells in a fixed environment, it has been possible to describe certain features of the place cell population, including the spatial distribution of fields within the apparatus, the average size of fields, and the {\textquotedblleft}intensity{\textquotedblright} of fields (as measured by maximum firing rate). We also tested the hypothesis that the firing rate of each place cell signals the animal{\textquoteright}s distance from a point (the field center) so that a weighted average of the firing of the individual cells encodes the animal{\textquoteright}s position within the apparatus. The animal{\textquoteright}s position, calculated according to this {\textquoteright}distance hypothesis,{\textquotedblright} is systematically different from the animal{\textquoteright}s true position; this implies that the hypothesis in its simplest form is wrong.",,,,,,,,,"Muller, RU and Kubie, JL and Ranck, JB",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-25 14:51:07 +0100,2021-01-25 14:51:29 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.07-07-01935.1987,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/7/7/1935.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,1935--1950,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Spatial firing patterns of hippocampal complex-spike cells in a fixed environment,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/7/7/1935,7,1987,

article,Mumford2012N,"Use of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to predict the cognitive state of a subject during task performance has become a popular focus of fMRI studies. The input to these analyses consists of activation patterns corresponding to different tasks or stimulus types. These activation patterns are fairly straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow event-related designs, but for rapid event-related designs the evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time, complicating the identification of signal unique to specific trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneficial to be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The present work compares 8 different models for estimating trial-by-trial activation patterns for a range of rapid event-related designs varying by interstimulus interval and signal-to-noise ratio. The most effective approach obtains each trial's estimate through a general linear model including a regressor for that trial as well as another regressor for all other trials. Through the analysis of both simulated and real data we have found that this model shows some improvement over the standard approaches for obtaining activation patterns. The resulting trial-by-trial estimates are more representative of the true activation magnitudes, leading to a boost in classification accuracy in fast event-related designs with higher signal-to-noise. This provides the potential for fMRI studies that allow simultaneous optimization of both univariate and MVPA approaches.",,,,,,,,,"Mumford, Jeanette A. and Turner, Benjamin O. and Ashby, F.

However, no conclusive behavioral evidence exists given that the influence of extrinsic reward on attention and motivation during encoding and consolidation processes are inherently confounded. The present study provides behavioral evidence that extrinsic rewards (i.e., monetary incentives) enhance human memory consolidation independently of attention and motivation. Participants saw neutral pictures, followed by a reward or control cue in an unrelated context. Our results (and a direct replication study) demonstrated that the reward cue predicted a retrograde enhancement of memory for the preceding neutral pictures. This retrograde effect was observed only after a delay, not immediately upon testing.

article,Murayama2011C,"Money's ability to enhance memory has received increased attention in recent research. However, previous studies have not directly addressed the time-dependent nature of monetary effects on memory, which are suggested to exist by research in cognitive neuroscience, and the possible detrimental effects of monetary rewards on learning interesting material, as indicated by studies in motivational psychology. By utilizing a trivia question paradigm, the current study incorporated these perspectives and examined the effect of monetary rewards on immediate and delayed memory performance for answers to uninteresting and interesting questions. Results showed that monetary rewards promote memory performance only after a delay. In addition, the memory enhancement effect of monetary rewards was only observed for uninteresting questions.

article,Murty2017JN,"Reward motivation has been demonstrated to enhance declarative memory by facilitating systems-level consolidation. Although high-reward information is often intermixed with lower reward information during an experience, memory for high value information is prioritized. How is this selectivity achieved? One possibility is that postencoding consolidation processes bias memory strengthening to those representations associated with higher reward. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of differential reward motivation on the selectivity of postencoding markers of systems-level memory consolidation. Human participants encoded intermixed, trial-unique memoranda that were associated with either high or low-value during fMRI acquisition. Encoding was interleaved with periods of rest, allowing us to investigate experience-dependent changes in connectivity as they related to later memory. Behaviorally, we found that reward motivation enhanced 24 h associative memory. Analysis of patterns of postencoding connectivity showed that, even though learning trials were intermixed, there was significantly greater connectivity with regions of high-level, category-selective visual cortex associated with high-reward trials. Specifically, increased connectivity of category-selective visual cortex with both the VTA and the anterior hippocampus predicted associative memory for high- but not low-reward memories. Critically, these results were independent of encoding-related connectivity and univariate activity measures. Thus, these findings support a model by which the selective stabilization of memories for salient events is supported by postencoding interactions with sensory cortex associated with reward.",,,,,,,,,"Murty, Vishnu P. and Tompary, Alexa and Adcock, R.

We argue that memory traces are transformed over time in a number of ways, but that understanding these transformations requires careful analysis of the various representations and linkages that result from an experience. These transformations can involve: (1) the selective strengthening of only some, but not all, traces as a function of synaptic rescaling, or some other process that can result in selective survival of some traces; (2) the integration (or assimilation) of new information into existing knowledge stores; (3) the establishment of new linkages within existing knowledge stores; and (4) the up-dating of an existing episodic memory.

article,Nakashiba2009N,"A widely held memory consolidation theory posits that memory of events and space is initially stored in the hippocampus (HPC) in a time-limited manner and is consolidated in the neocortex for permanent storage. Although posttraining HPC lesions result in temporally graded amnesia, the precise HPC circuits and mechanisms involved in remote memory storage remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of the trisynaptic pathway in the consolidation process we employed the CA3-TeTX transgenic mouse, in which CA3 output can be specifically and inducibly controlled. We found that posttraining blockade of CA3 output for up to 4 weeks impairs the consolidation of contextual fear memory. Moreover, in vivo hippocampal recordings revealed a reduced intrinsic frequency of CA1 ripples and a significant decrease in the experience-dependent, ripple-associated coordinated reactivation of CA1 cell pairs. Collectively, these results suggest that the posttraining integrity of the trisynaptic pathway and the ripple-associated reactivation of hippocampal memory engram are crucial for memory consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Nakashiba, Toshiaki and Buhl, Derek L. and McHugh, Thomas J. and Tonegawa, Susumu",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-12 18:24:27 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2009.05.013,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,6,,,781--787,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,ripples; replay; reactivation; memory,,Hippocampal CA3 Output Is Crucial for Ripple-Associated Reactivation and Consolidation of Memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2009.05.013,62,2009,
article,Nakazawa2002S,"Pattern completion, the ability to retrieve complete memories on the basis of incomplete sets of cues, is a crucial function of biological memory systems. The extensive recurrent connectivity of the CA3 area of hippocampus has led to suggestions that it might provide this function. We have tested this hypothesis by generating and analyzing a genetically engineered mouse strain in which theN-methyl-d-asparate (NMDA) receptor gene is ablated specifically in the CA3 pyramidal cells of adult mice. The mutant mice normally acquired and retrieved spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze, but they were impaired in retrieving this memory when presented with a fraction of the original cues. Similarly, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in mutant mice displayed normal place-related activity in a full-cue environment but showed a reduction in activity upon partial cue removal.

article,Naumann2020PCB,"Hebbian plasticity, a mechanism believed to be the substrate of learning and memory, detects and further enhances correlated neural activity. Because this constitutes an unstable positive feedback loop, it requires additional homeostatic control. Computational work suggests that in recurrent networks, the homeostatic mechanisms observed in experiments are too slow to compensate instabilities arising from Hebbian plasticity and need to be complemented by rapid compensatory processes. We suggest presynaptic inhibition as a candidate that rapidly provides stability by compensating recurrent excitation induced by Hebbian changes. Presynaptic inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors that effectively and reversibly attenuate transmitter release. Activation of these receptors can be triggered by excess network activity, hence providing a stabilising negative feedback loop that weakens recurrent interactions on sub-second timescales. We study the stabilising effect of presynaptic inhibition in recurrent networks, in which presynaptic inhibition is implemented as a multiplicative reduction of recurrent synaptic weights in response to increasing inhibitory activity. We show that networks with presynaptic inhibition display a gradual increase of firing rates with growing excitatory weights, in contrast to traditional excitatory-inhibitory networks. This alleviates the positive feedback loop between Hebbian plasticity and network activity and thereby allows homeostasis to act on timescales similar to those observed in experiments. Our results generalise to spiking networks with a biophysically more detailed implementation of the presynaptic inhibition mechanism. In conclusion, presynaptic inhibition provides a powerful compensatory mechanism that rapidly reduces effective recurrent interactions and thereby stabilises Hebbian learning.",,,,,,,,,"Naumann, Laura Bella and Sprekeler, Henning",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-21 16:11:12 +0200,2020-08-21 16:11:49 +0200,,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008118,,,"Rubin, Jonathan",,,,,,,,,,,,{PLOS} Computational Biology,,,,,,,,,,,aug,,,8,,,e1008118,,,,Public Library of Science ({PLoS}),,,,,,,,Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitation in the face of plasticity,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1008118,16,2020,

article,Navratilova2012FNC,"When rodents engage in irregular foraging in an open-field environment, hippocampal principal cells exhibit place-specific firing that is statistically independent of the direction of traverse through the place field. When the path is restricted to a track, however, in-field rates differ substantially in opposite directions. Frequently, the representations of the track in the two directions are essentially orthogonal. We show that this directionally selective firing is not hard-wired, but develops through experience-dependent plasticity. During the rats' first pass in each direction, place fields were highly directionally symmetric, whereas over subsequent laps, the firing rates in the two directions gradually but substantially diverged. We conclude that, even on a restricted track, place cell firing is initially determined by allocentric position, and only later, the within-field firing rates change in response to differential sensory information or behavioral cues in the two directions. In agreement with previous data, place fields near local cues, such as textures on the track, developed less directionality than place fields on a uniform part of the track, possibly because the local cues reduced the net difference in sensory input at a given point. Directionality also developed in an open environment without physical restriction of the animal's path, when rats learned to run along a specified path. In this case, directionality developed later than on the running track, only after the rats began to run in a stereotyped manner. Although the average population firing rates exhibited little if any change over laps in either direction, the direction-specific firing rates in a given place field were up-or down-regulated with about equal probability and magnitude, which was independent in the two directions, suggesting some form of competitive mechanism (e.g., LTP/LTD) acting coherently on the set of synapses conveying external information to each cell.",,,,,,,,,"Navratilova, Zaneta and Hoang, Lan and Schwindel, C and Tatsuno, Masami and McNaughton, Bruce",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-11 17:01:28 +0100,2020-12-11 17:01:44 +0100,,,10.3389/fncir.2012.00006,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5110,,,Frontiers in Neural Circuits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,Experience-dependent firing rate remapping generates directional selectivity in hippocampal place cells,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2012.00006,6,2012,

Casting caused cortical and cerebellar regions controlling the disused extremity to functionally disconnect from the rest of the somatomotor system, while internal connectivity within the disused sub-circuit was maintained. Functional disconnection was evident within 48 h, progressed throughout the cast period, and reversed after cast removal. During the cast period, large, spontaneous pulses of activity propagated through the disused somatomotor sub-circuit.

article,Newman2012PBR,"Perhaps the most common method of depicting data, in both scientific communication and popular media, is the bar graph. Bar graphs often depict measures of central tendency, but they do so asymmetrically: A mean, for example, is depicted not by a point, but by the edge of a bar that originates from a single axis. Here we show that this graphical asymmetry gives rise to a corresponding cognitive asymmetry. When viewers are shown a bar depicting a mean value and are then asked to judge the likelihood of a particular data point being part of its underlying distribution, viewers judge points that fall within the bar as being more likely than points equidistant from the mean, but outside the bar---as if the bar somehow ``contained'' the relevant data. This ``within-the-bar bias'' occurred (a) for graphs with and without error bars, (b) for bars that originated from both lower and upper axes, (c) for test points with equally extreme numeric labels, (d) both from memory (when the bar was no longer visible) and in online perception (while the bar was visible during the judgment), (e) both within and between subjects, and (f) in populations including college students, adults from the broader community, and online samples.

article,Nili2014PCB,"Neuronal population codes are increasingly being investigated with multivariate pattern-information analyses. A key challenge is to use measured brain-activity patterns to test computational models of brain information processing. One approach to this problem is representational similarity analysis (RSA), which characterizes a representation in a brain or computational model by the distance matrix of the response patterns elicited by a set of stimuli. The representational distance matrix encapsulates what distinctions between stimuli are emphasized and what distinctions are de-emphasized in the representation. A model is tested by comparing the representational distance matrix it predicts to that of a measured brain region. RSA also enables us to compare representations between stages of processing within a given brain or model, between brain and behavioral data, and between individuals and species. Here, we introduce a Matlab toolbox for RSA. The toolbox supports an analysis approach that is simultaneously data- and hypothesis-driven. It is designed to help integrate a wide range of computational models into the analysis of multichannel brain-activity measurements as provided by modern functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques. Tools for visualization and inference enable the user to relate sets of models to sets of brain regions and to statistically test and compare the models using nonparametric inference methods. The toolbox supports searchlight-based RSA, to continuously map a measured brain volume in search of a neuronal population code with a specific geometry. Finally, we introduce the linear-discriminant t value as a measure of representational discriminability that bridges the gap between linear decoding analyses and RSA. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the toolbox, we apply it to both simulated and real fMRI data. The key functions are equally applicable to other modalities of brain-activity measurement.

We demonstrate that this coupling is brain state-dependent, and delineate a topographically-organized anatomical pathway via VGlut2-expressing, bursty neurons in the subiculum. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of bursty subicular cells induced or reduced responses in superficial gRSC, respectively.

article,Niv2019NN,"Arguably, the most difficult part of learning is deciding what to learn about. Should I associate the positive outcome of safely completing a street-crossing with the situation `the car approaching the crosswalk was red' or with `the approaching car was slowing down'? In this Perspective, we summarize our recent research into the computational and neural underpinnings of `representation learning'---how humans (and other animals) construct task representations that allow efficient learning and decision-making.

article,Nokia2010JN,"There are at least two distinct oscillatory states of the hippocampus that are related to distinct behavioral patterns. Theta (4--12 Hz) oscillation has been suggested to indicate selective attention during which the animal concentrates on some features of the environment while suppressing reactivity to others. In contrast, sharp-wave ripples (∼200 Hz) can be seen in a state in which the hippocampus is at its most responsive to any kind of afferent stimulation. In addition, external stimulation tends to evoke and reset theta oscillation, the phase of which has been shown to modulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Theoretically, training on a hippocampus-dependent learning task contingent upon ripples could enhance learning rate due to elevated responsiveness and enhanced phase locking of the theta oscillation. We used a brain--computer interface to detect hippocampal ripples in rabbits to deliver trace eyeblink conditioning and extinction trials selectively contingent upon them. A yoked control group was trained regardless of their ongoing neural state. Ripple-contingent training expedited acquisition of the conditioned response early in training and evoked stronger theta-band phase locking to the conditioned stimulus. Surprisingly, ripple-contingent training also resulted in slower extinction in well trained animals. We suggest that the ongoing oscillatory activity in the hippocampus determines the extent to which a stimulus can induce a phase reset of the theta oscillation, which in turn is the determining factor of learning rate in trace eyeblink conditioning.",,,,,,,,,"Nokia, M.

article,Nomoto2010JN,"Midbrain dopamine neurons respond to reward-predictive stimuli. In the natural environment reward-predictive stimuli are often perceptually complicated. Thus, to discriminate one stimulus from another, elaborate sensory processing is necessary. Given that previous studies have used simpler types of reward-predictive stimuli, it has yet to be clear whether and, if so, how dopamine neurons obtain reward information from perceptually complicated stimuli. To investigate this, we recorded the activities of monkey dopamine neurons while they were performing discrimination between two coherent motion directions in random-dot motion stimuli. These coherent directions were paired with different magnitudes of reward. We found that dopamine neurons showed reward-predictive responses to random-dot motion stimuli. Moreover, dopamine neurons showed temporally extended activity correlated with changes in reward prediction (i.e., reward prediction error) from coarse to fine scales between initial motion detection and subsequent motion discrimination phases. Noticeably, dopamine reward-predictive responses became differential in a later phase than previously reported. This response pattern was consistent with the time course of processing required for the estimation of expected reward value that parallels the motion direction discrimination processing. The results demonstrate that dopamine neurons are able to reflect the reward value of perceptually complicated stimuli, and suggest that dopamine neurons use the moment-to-moment reward prediction associated with environmental stimuli to compute a reward prediction error.",,,,,,,,,"Nomoto, Kensaku and Schultz, Wolfram and Watanabe, Takeo and Sakagami, Masamichi",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 12:34:37 +0100,2021-01-27 12:34:55 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4828-09.2010,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/32/10692.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32,,,10692--10702,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Temporally Extended Dopamine Responses to Perceptually Demanding Reward-Predictive Stimuli,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/32/10692,30,2010,

In this paper, we critically evaluate how well the Complementary Learning Systems theory of hippocampo--cortical interactions addresses the stability--plasticity problem. We identify two major challenges for the model: Finding a learning algorithm for cortex and hippocampus that enacts selective strengthening of weak memories, and selective punishment of competing memories; and preventing catastrophic forgetting in the case of non-stationary environments (i.e. when items are temporarily removed from the training set). We then discuss potential solutions to these problems: First, we describe a recently developed learning algorithm that leverages neural oscillations to find weak parts of memories (so they can be strengthened) and strong competitors (so they can be punished), and we show how this algorithm outperforms other learning algorithms (CPCA Hebbian learning and Leabra at memorizing overlapping patterns. Second, we describe how autonomous re-activation of memories (separately in cortex and hippocampus) during REM sleep, coupled with the oscillating learning algorithm, can reduce the rate of forgetting of input patterns that are no longer present in the environment.

article,Nosek2015S,"Transparency, openness, and reproducibility are readily recognized as vital features of science (1, 2). When asked, most scientists embrace these features as disciplinary norms and values (3). Therefore, one might expect that these valued features would be routine in daily practice. Yet, a growing body of evidence suggests that this is not the case (4--6). A likely culprit for this disconnect is an academic reward system that does not sufficiently incentivize open practices (7). In the present reward system, emphasis on innovation may undermine practices that support verification. Too often, publication requirements (whether actual or perceived) fail to encourage transparent, open, and reproducible science (2, 4, 8, 9). For example, in a transparent science, both null results and statistically significant results are made available and help others more accurately assess the evidence base for a phenomenon. In the present culture, however, null results are published less frequently than statistically significant results (10) and are, therefore, more likely inaccessible and lost in the ``file drawer'' (11). The situation is a classic collective action problem. Many individual researchers lack strong incentives to be more transparent, even though the credibility of science would benefit if everyone were more transparent. Unfortunately, there is no centralized means of aligning individual and communal incentives via universal scientific policies and procedures. Universities, granting agencies, and publishers each create different incentives for researchers.

article,Nour2018PNAS,"Distinguishing between meaningful and meaningless sensory information is fundamental to forming accurate representations of the world. Dopamine is thought to play a central role in processing the meaningful information content of observations, which motivates an agent to update their beliefs about the environment. However, direct evidence for dopamine's role in human belief updating is lacking. We addressed this question in healthy volunteers who performed a model-based fMRI task designed to separate the neural processing of meaningful and meaningless sensory information. We modeled participant behavior using a normative Bayesian observer model and used the magnitude of the model-derived belief update following an observation to quantify its meaningful information content. We also acquired PET imaging measures of dopamine function in the same subjects. We show that the magnitude of belief updates about task structure (meaningful information), but not pure sensory surprise (meaningless information), are encoded in midbrain and ventral striatum activity. Using PET we show that the neural encoding of meaningful information is negatively related to dopamine-2/3 receptor availability in the midbrain and dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release capacity in the striatum. Trial-by-trial analysis of task performance indicated that subclinical paranoid ideation is negatively related to behavioral sensitivity to observations carrying meaningful information about the task structure. The findings provide direct evidence implicating dopamine in model-based belief updating in humans and have implications for understating the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders where dopamine function is disrupted.",,,,,,,,,"Nour, Matthew M. and Dahoun, Tarik and Schwartenbeck, Philipp and Adams, Rick A. and FitzGerald, Thomas H.

Here we examined the temporal coordination of pyramidal cell spikes in the rat hippocampus during slow-wave sleep. In addition, rats were trained to run in a defined position in space (running wheel) to activate a selected group of pyramidal cells. A template-matching method and a joint probability map method were used for sequence search. Repeating spike sequences in excess of chance occurrence were examined by comparing the number of repeating sequences in the original spike trains and in surrogate trains after Monte Carlo shuffling of the spikes. Four different shuffling procedures were used to control for the population dynamics of hippocampal neurons. Repeating spike sequences in the recorded cell assemblies were present in both the awake and sleeping animal in excess of what might be predicted by random variations. Spike sequences observed during wheel running were ``replayed'' at a faster timescale during single sharp-wave bursts of slow-wave sleep. We hypothesize that the endogenously expressed spike sequences during sleep reflect reactivation of the circuitry modified by previous experience.

article,OCallaghan2021PTRSBS," Mind-wandering has become a captivating topic for cognitive neuroscientists. By now, it is reasonably well described in terms of its phenomenology and the large-scale neural networks that support it. However, we know very little about what neurobiological mechanisms trigger a mind-wandering episode and sustain the mind-wandering brain state. Here, we focus on the role of ascending neuromodulatory systems (i.e. acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine) in shaping mind-wandering. We advance the hypothesis that the hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SWR) is a compelling candidate for a brain state that can trigger mind-wandering episodes. This hippocampal rhythm, which occurs spontaneously in quiescent behavioural states, is capable of propagating widespread activity in the default network and is functionally associated with recollective, associative, imagination and simulation processes. The occurrence of the SWR is heavily dependent on hippocampal neuromodulatory tone. We describe how the interplay of neuromodulators may promote the hippocampal SWR and trigger mind-wandering episodes. We then identify the global neuromodulatory signatures that shape the evolution of the mind-wandering brain state. Under our proposed framework, mind-wandering emerges due to the interplay between neuromodulatory systems that influence the transitions between brain states, which either facilitate, or impede, a wandering mind. This article is part of the theme issue `Offline perception: voluntary and spontaneous perceptual experiences without matching external stimulation'.

Some of these place units (misplace units) fired maximally when the animal sniffed in a place, either because it found something new there or failed to find something which was usually there. Displace units increased their rates during behaviors associated with theta activity in the hippocampal slow waves. In general these were behaviors which changed the rat's position relative to the environment. The influence of various environmental manipulations (e.g., turning off the room lights) on the firing pattern of the place units was tested and the results suggest that they were not responding to a simple sensory stimulus nor to a specific motor behavior.

article,OKeefe1993H,"Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast, the hippocampal electroer cephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7--12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100$\,^{\circ}$ to 355$\,^{\circ}$ in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.",,,,,,,,,"O'Keefe, John and Recce, Michael L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-27 12:10:31 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.450030307,,,,,,,,,,,,1098-1063,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,3,,,317--330,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the {EEG} theta rhythm,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.450030307,3,1993,
article,ONeill2017S,"The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp wave--ripples, in which synchronous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording assembly activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex.

article,ONeill2010TN,"Episodic and spatial memories each involve the encoding of complex associations in hippocampal neuronal circuits. Such memory traces could be stabilised from short- to long-term forms by consolidation processes involving the `reactivation' of the original network firing patterns during sleep and rest. Waking experience can be replayed in many different brain areas, but an important role for the hippocampus lies in the organisation of the `reactivation' process. Emerging evidence suggests that sharp wave/ripple (SWR) events in the hippocampus could coordinate the reactivation of memory traces and direct their reinstatement in cortical circuits.

Indeed, the joint firing of spatially tuned pyramidal cells encoding nearby places recur during sleep. We found that the sleep cofiring of rat CA1 pyramidal cells encoding similar places increased relative to the sleep session before exploration. This cofiring increase depended on the number of times that cells fired together with short latencies (<50 ms) during exploration, and was strongest between cells representing the most visited places. This is indicative of a Hebbian learning rule in which changes in firing associations between cells are determined by the number of waking coincident firing events. In contrast, cells encoding different locations reduced their cofiring in proportion to the number of times that they fired independently.

However, neuronal activity during eSWR was location dependent, and eSWR-related firing was stronger inside the place field than outside. The eSPW-related firing increase was stronger than the baseline increase inside compared to outside, suggesting a ``supralinear'' summation of eSWR and place-selective inputs. Pairs of cells with similar place fields and/or correlated firing during exploration showed stronger coactivation during eSWRs and subsequent sleep-SWRs.

This framework explains why the brain requires two differentially specialized learning and memory systems, and it nicely specifies their central properties (i.e., the hippocampus as a sparse, pattern-separated system for rapidly learning episodic memories, and the neocortex as a distributed, overlapping system for gradually integrating across episodes to extract latent semantic structure). We review the application of the CLS framework to a range of important topics, including the following: the basic neural processes of hippocampal memory encoding and recall, conjunctive encoding, human recognition memory, consolidation of initial hippocampal learning in cortex, dynamic modulation of encoding versus recall, and the synergistic interactions between hippocampus and neocortex.

article,OReilly2006NC,"The prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory (the holding of information online for processing) and executive functions (deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing). Although many computational models of working memory have been developed, the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive, often amounting to a homunculus. This article presents an attempt to deconstruct this homunculus through powerful learning mechanisms that allow a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and amygdala, which together form an actor-critic architecture. The critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating. Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems. The model's performance compares favorably with standard backpropagation-based temporal learning mechanisms on the challenging 1-2-AX working memory task and other benchmark working memory tasks.

An identical algorithm learned to classify an image-based, view-dependent representation of the stimuli. High correlations were found between the confusability of object categories and the confusability of brain activity maps.

article,Obels2020AMPPS,"Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58\%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58\%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement.

article,Ogawa2000PNAS,"In this paper, we demonstrate an approach by which some evoked neuronal events can be probed by functional MRI (fMRI) signal with temporal resolution at the time scale of tens of milliseconds. The approach is based on the close relationship between neuronal electrical events and fMRI signal that is experimentally demonstrated in concurrent fMRI and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies conducted in a rat model with forepaw electrical stimulation. We observed a refractory period of neuronal origin in a two-stimuli paradigm: the first stimulation pulse suppressed the evoked activity in both EEG and fMRI signal responding to the subsequent stimulus for a period of several hundred milliseconds. When there was an apparent site--site interaction detected in the evoked EEG signal induced by two stimuli that were primarily targeted to activate two different sites in the brain, fMRI also displayed signal amplitude modulation because of the interactive event. With visual stimulation using two short pulses in the human brain, a similar refractory phenomenon was observed in activated fMRI signals in the primary visual cortex. In addition, for interstimulus intervals shorter than the known latency time of the evoked potential induced by the first stimulus (≈100 ms) in the primary visual cortex of the human brain, the suppression was not present.

However, how alterations in the firing patterns of place cells in response to aversive events encode the locations tied to these aversive events is unknown. Here, we analyzed spiking patterns of place cell ensembles in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region of rats performing a T-maze alternation task with an aversive air-puff stimulation applied at a specific location on one side of a trajectory. The intensity of the air puff was adjusted so that the rats decreased their running speed before passing the aversive location. The addition of the aversive stimulus induced reorganization of place cell ensembles on both left and right trajectories with and without the aversive stimulus, respectively. Specifically, the animals showed a more abundant spatial representation in the vicinity of the aversive location. Removing the aversive stimulus induced new spatial firing patterns on both of the trajectories that differed from those both before and during application of the aversive stimulus.

article,Oler2008EJN,"In humans the hippocampus plays a role in both episodic memory and spatial navigation. Similar findings have been shown in other animals including monkeys and rats. The relationship between the processing of episodic and spatial related inputs within the hippocampus remains a puzzle.

Hippocampal pyramidal cells can alter their spatial tuning (re‐map) in response to changes in task demands. The degree to which this re‐mapping is related to contextual/episodic information or to changes in spatial navigation/trajectories is unclear. The current study was designed to examine cell activity under two conditions that differed in contextual information without alterations in the goal‐directed trajectories taken by the animals. Adult and aged rats were trained to do an alternation task on a fixed pathway [J. A. Oler et al. (2005)Neuroscience, 131, 1--12]. The animals ran this pathway during either `safe' or `unsafe' (a tone indicating a shock region) trials, with hesitation during `unsafe' trials providing a clear behavioral measure of discrimination between these two conditions. Relatively few place cells displayed re‐mapping between the two conditions. We propose that the principle source of re‐mapping in the dorsal hippocampus is changes in the animal's trajectories rather than behavioral context. Possible reasons why so few cells responded to the change in context are discussed.",,,,,,,,,"Oler, Jonathan A. and Penley, Stephanie C. and Sava, Simona and Markus, Etan J.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL29sZXIyMDA4ZWpuLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w9vbGVyMjAwOGVqbi5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6b2xlcjIwMDhlam4ucGRmAA4AIAAPAG8AbABlAHIAMgAwADAAOABlAGoAbgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9vbGVyMjAwOGVqbi5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-07 10:46:24 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06375.x,,,,,,,,,,,,1460-9568,,,European Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,4,,,802--812,,,,Wiley,,,,,,place cells; replay; disorders,,Does the dorsal hippocampus process navigational routes or behavioral context?

article,Oliva2020N,"The consolidation of spatial memory depends on the reactivation (`replay') of hippocampal place cells that were active during recent behaviour. Such reactivation is observed during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)---synchronous oscillatory electrical events that occur during non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep1--8 and whose disruption impairs spatial memory3,5,6,8. Although the hippocampus also encodes a wide range of non-spatial forms of declarative memory, it is not yet known whether SWRs are necessary for such memories. Moreover, although SWRs can arise from either the CA3 or the CA2 region of the hippocampus7,9, the relative importance of SWRs from these regions for memory consolidation is unknown. Here we examine the role of SWRs during the consolidation of social memory---the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a member of the same species---focusing on CA2 because of its essential role in social memory10--12. We find that ensembles of CA2 pyramidal neurons that are active during social exploration of previously unknown conspecifics are reactivated during SWRs. Notably, disruption or enhancement of CA2 SWRs suppresses or prolongs social memory, respectively. Thus, SWR-mediated reactivation of hippocampal firing related to recent experience appears to be a general mechanism for binding spatial, temporal and sensory information into high-order memory representations, including social memory.",,,,,,,,,"Oliva, Azahara and Fern{\'a}ndez-Ruiz, Antonio and Leroy, Felix and Siegelbaum, Steven A.",,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,,,,,,,,,2020/11/01,,2020-12-22 12:51:25 +0100,2020-12-22 12:56:53 +0100,,,10.1038/s41586-020-2758-y,,,,,,,,,Oliva2020,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7833,,,264--269,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampal CA2 sharp-wave ripples reactivate and promote social memory,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2758-y,587,2020,

A clear differentiation of cellular activity is seen between those areas of Cajal's regio superior, regio inferior and fascia dentata. During paradoxical sleep the regio superior shows its lowest level of activity, while regio inferior and fascia dentata show their highest levels.

article,Olson2021JESP,"Social psychologists, placebo scientists, and consumer researchers often require deception in their studies, yet they receive little training on how to deceive effectively. Ineffective deception, however, can lead to suspicion and compromise the validity of research. The field of magic offers a potential solution; magicians have deceived audiences for millennia using a variety of robust techniques. As former professional magicians, we propose the Swiss cheese model of deception and argue that deception should be subtle yet elaborate. Subtle deception involves techniques such as fake mistakes, planted assumptions, and convincers. Elaborate deception involves layering many of these techniques rather than relying on a single cover story. We have demonstrated the potency of these principles by making participants believe implausible ideas, such as that a machine is controlling their mind or that the placebo they consumed was a psychedelic drug. These principles can help researchers reduce demand characteristics, improve blinding, and increase the generalisability of studies that require deception.",,,,,,,,,"Olson, Jay A. and Raz, Amir",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 12:46:57 +0100,2021-01-27 12:47:42 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2020.104053,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1031,,,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,,,"Deception, Suspicion, Magic, Placebo, Blinding, Ethics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,104053,,,,,,,,,,,,Applying insights from magic to improve deception in research: The Swiss cheese model,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103120303930,92,2021,
article,Olton1979AP,"Reviews the literature on the history of maze testing, focusing on the issue of behavioral stereotypy vs behavioral flexibility. Early experiments were based on the ""kinesthetic machine"" hypothesis, which held that (a) stimuli arise in some sort of temporal sequence from the activity of the muscles as the animal traverses the maze pattern and (b) during the process of learning this temporal sequence becomes fixed. Subsequent experiments emphasized the variability of behavior and showed that in many situations animals chose not to repeat their previous choices. J. F. Dashiell (1930), W. S. Small (1900, 1901), and others demonstrated that rats tended to explore their spatial environments in exhaustive detail. The development of the radial-arm maze, a spatial analog of the operant delayed matching-to-sample procedure, provided a means for systematic investigation of working memory in animals. Cognitive maps are discussed in terms of the sunburst maze of E. C. Tolman et al (1946) and the successful use of maplike structures with chimpanzees shown by E. W. Menzel (1973, 1978). The question of how an animal decides to search for food and the extent to which this decision process in a natural habitat is related to that in a laboratory maze is addressed. The data reviewed show that in spatial tasks, rats and other animals have the ability to remember information and to use it appropriately in a flexible, adaptive manner.

Correlates of RPEs have been observed in the midbrain dopamine system, but the extent to which RPE signals exist in other reward-processing regions is less well understood. In the present study, we quantified outcome history-based RPE signals in the ventral pallidum (VP), a basal ganglia region functionally linked to reward-seeking behavior. We trained rats to respond to reward-predicting cues, and we fit computational models to predict the firing rates of individual neurons at the time of reward delivery. We found that a subset of VP neurons encoded RPEs and did so more robustly than the nucleus accumbens, an input to the VP. VP RPEs predicted changes in task engagement, and optogenetic manipulation of the VP during reward delivery bidirectionally altered rats' subsequent reward-seeking behavior.

article,Oudiette2013JN,"Consolidation makes it possible for memories of our daily experiences to be stored in an enduring way. We propose that memory consolidation depends on the covert reactivation of previously learned material both during sleep and wakefulness. Here we tested whether the operation of covert memory reactivation influences the fundamental selectivity of memory storage{\textemdash}of all the events we experience each day, which will be retained and which forgotten? We systematically manipulated the value of information learned by 60 young subjects; they learned 72 object-location associations while hearing characteristic object sounds, and a number on each object indicated the reward value that could potentially be earned during a future memory test. Recall accuracy declined to a greater extent for low-value than for high-value associations after either a 90 min nap or a 90 min wake interval. Yet, via targeted memory reactivation of half of the low-value associations using the corresponding sounds, these memories were rescued from forgetting. Only cued associations were rescued when sounds were applied during wakefulness, whereas the entire set of low-value associations was rescued from forgetting when the manipulation occurred during sleep. The benefits accrued from presenting corresponding sounds show that covert reactivation is a major factor determining the selectivity of memory consolidation in these circumstances. By extension, covert reactivation may determine the ultimate fate of our memories, though wake and sleep reactivation might play distinct roles in this process, the former helping to strengthen individual, salient memories, and the latter strengthening, while also linking, categorically related memories together.",,,,,,,,,"Oudiette, Delphine and Antony, James W. and Creery, Jessica D. and Paller, Ken A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-19 12:05:43 +0100,2021-01-19 12:06:06 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5497-12.2013,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/15/6672.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,6672--6678,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,The Role of Memory Reactivation during Wakefulness and Sleep in Determining Which Memories Endure,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/15/6672,33,2013,
article,Oudiette2013TCS,A fundamental feature of human memory is the propensity for beneficial changes in information storage after initial encoding. Recent research findings favor the possibility that memory consolidation during sleep is instrumental for actively maintaining the storehouse of memories that individuals carry through their lives. The information that ultimately remains available for retrieval may tend to be that which is reactivated during sleep. A novel source of support for this idea comes from demonstrations that neurocognitive processing during sleep can benefit memory storage when memories are covertly cued via auditory or olfactory stimulation. Investigations of these subtle manipulations of memory processing during sleep can help elucidate the mechanisms of memory preservation in the human brain.,,,,,,,,,"Oudiette, Delphine and Paller, Ken A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-20 15:44:26 +0100,2021-01-20 15:44:56 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.01.006,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6613,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,142 - 149,,,,,,,,,,,,Upgrading the sleeping brain with targeted memory reactivation,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466131300020X,17,2013,

article,Panoz-Brown2018CB,"Vivid episodic memories in people have been characterized as the replay of multiple unique events in sequential order [1, 2, 3]. The hippocampus plays a critical role in episodic memories in both people and rodents [2, 4, 5, 6]. Although rats remember multiple unique episodes [7, 8], it is currently unknown if animals ``replay'' episodic memories. Therefore, we developed an animal model of episodic memory replay. Here, we show that rats can remember a trial-unique stream of multiple episodes and the order in which these events occurred by engaging hippocampal-dependent episodic memory replay. We document that rats rely on episodic memory replay to remember the order of events rather than relying on non-episodic memories. Replay of episodic memories survives a long retention-interval challenge and interference from the memory of other events, which documents that replay is part of long-term episodic memory. The chemogenetic activating drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO), but not vehicle, reversibly impairs episodic memory replay in rats previously injected bilaterally in the hippocampus with a recombinant viral vector containing an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD; AAV8-hSyn-hM4Di-mCherry). By contrast, two non-episodic memory assessments are unaffected by CNO, showing selectivity of this hippocampal-dependent impairment. Our approach provides an animal model of episodic memory replay, a process by which the rat searches its representations in episodic memory in sequential order to find information. Our findings using rats suggest that the ability to replay a stream of episodic memories is quite old in the evolutionary timescale.",,,,,,,,,"Panoz-Brown, Danielle and Iyer, Vishakh and Carey, Lawrence M. and Sluka, Christina M. and Rajic, Gabriela and Kestenman, Jesse and Gentry, Meredith and Brotheridge, Sydney and Somekh, Isaac and Corbin, Hannah E. and Tucker, Kjersten G. and Almeida, Bianca and Hex, Severine B. and Garcia, Krysten D. and Hohmann, Andrea G. and Crystal, Jonathon D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-21 16:40:33 +0100,2020-12-21 16:40:57 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.006,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,"episodic memory, replay, episodic replay, hippocampus, DREADD, rat, familiarity",,,,,,,,,,,10,,,1628 - 1634.e7,,,,,,,,,,,,Replay of Episodic Memories in the Rat,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218304342,28,2018,

Hippocampal sharp-wave-ripple (SWR) events have been linked to this consolidation process during sleep, but SWRs also occur during awake immobility, where their role remains unclear. We report that awake SWR rates at the reward site are inversely related to the prevalence of vicarious trial and error (VTE) behaviors, thought to be involved in deliberation processes. SWR rates were diminished immediately after VTE behaviors and an increase in the rate of SWR events at the reward site predicted a decrease in subsequent VTE behaviors at the choice point. Furthermore, SWR disruptions increased VTE behaviors. These results suggest an inverse relationship between SWRs and VTE behaviors and suggest that awake SWRs and associated planning and memory consolidation mechanisms are engaged specifically in the context of higher levels of behavioral certainty.",,,,,,,,,"Papale, Andrew E. and Zielinski, Mark C. and Frank, Loren M. and Jadhav, Shantanu P. and Redish, A.

article,Parisi2019NN,"Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.",,,,,,,,,"Parisi, German I. and Kemker, Ronald and Part, Jose L. and Kanan, Christopher and Wermter, Stefan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 13:40:36 +0100,2020-10-29 13:41:03 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2019.01.012,,,,,,,,,,,,0893-6080,,,Neural Networks,,,"Continual learning, Lifelong learning, Catastrophic forgetting, Developmental systems, Memory consolidation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,54 - 71,,,,,,,,,,,,Continual lifelong learning with neural networks: A review,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608019300231,113,2019,

article,Parker2019FN,"Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from each other. To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it (1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, (2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and (3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined. Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level. We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing.

During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors.

article,Patil2017LM,"Reward motivation has been shown to modulate episodic memory processes in order to support future adaptive behavior. However, for a memory system to be truly adaptive, it should enhance memory for rewarded events as well as for neutral events that may seem inconsequential at the time of encoding but can gain importance later.

article,Pavlides1989JN,"Rat hippocampal (CA1) complex spike ``place cells'' of freely behaving rats were recorded in pairs continuously during a series of waking (exploration and still-alert), drowsy (quiet-awake), and sleeping (slow- wave, pre-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep) behaviors. Pairs of units were selected that had nonoverlapping place fields. The rats were restricted from entering the place field of either cell overnight, and on the day of recording cells were exposed to their individual place fields independently and in a counterbalanced manner. Following exposure, recordings were made in the subsequent sleep episodes and the firing characteristics of both cells were analyzed. Following exposure, significant increases in the spiking activity of the exposed cell were observed in the subsequent sleeping states that were not evident in the unexposed cell. The increased activity was observed in the rate of firing (spikes/sec), the rate of occurrence of bursts with multiple spikes, as well as the number of bursts displaying short (2--4 msec) interspike intervals. The findings suggest that neuronal activity of hippocampal place cells in the awake states may influence the firing characteristics of these cells in subsequent sleep episodes. The increased firing rates along with the greater number of multiple spike bursts and the shorter interspike intervals within the burst, following exposure to a cell's place field, may represent possible information processing during sleep.",,,,,,,,,"Pavlides, C and Winson, J",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-19 09:18:20 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.09-08-02907.1989,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,2907--2918,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,replay,,Influences of hippocampal place cell firing in the awake state on the activity of these cells during subsequent sleep episodes,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.09-08-02907.1989,9,1989,
article,Payne2020B,"The hippocampus is an ancient neural circuit required for the formation of episodic memories. In mammals, this ability is thought to depend on well-documented patterns of neural activity, including place cells and sharp wave ripples. Notably, neither pattern has been found in non-mammals, despite compelling examples of episodic-like memory across a wide range of vertebrates. Does episodic memory nonetheless have a universal implementation across distant neural systems? We addressed this question by recording neural activity in the hippocampus of the tufted titmouse -- an intense memory specialist from a food-caching family of birds. These birds cache large numbers of food items at scattered, concealed locations and use hippocampus-dependent memory to retrieve their caches. We found remarkably precise spatial representations akin to classic place cells, as well as sharp wave ripples, in the titmouse hippocampus. These patterns were organized along similar anatomical axes to those found in mammals. In contrast, spatial coding was weaker in a different, non-food-caching bird species. Our findings suggest a striking conservation of hippocampal mechanisms across distant vertebrates, in spite of vastly divergent anatomy and cytoarchitecture. At the same time, these results demonstrate that the exact implementation of such common mechanisms may conform to the unique ethological needs of different species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Payne, Hannah L. and Lynch, Galen F. and Aronov, Dmitriy",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 16:52:38 +0100,2020-11-30 16:52:59 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.11.27.399444,,,,,2020.11.27.399444,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/27/2020.11.27.399444.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Precise spatial representations in the hippocampus of a food-caching bird,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/27/2020.11.27.399444,,2020,

article,Paz-Villagran2004EJN,"Place cells are hippocampal neurons that have a strong location-specific firing activity in the rat's current environment. Collectively, place cells also provide a signature of the rat's environment as their ensemble activity is markedly different when recorded in distinct apparatuses. This phenomenon, referred to as `remapping', suggests that each environment activates a different hippocampal map. In this study, we sought to determine the independence of such maps. In Experiment 1, we used a cylinder apparatus that was divided into two equal halves by a central barrier with an aperture allowing the rat to freely commute between the two sides. A local change in one side failed to induce field remapping in the changed side, thus precluding any significant conclusion to be drawn. We therefore designed Experiment 2 in which place cells were first recorded while rats explored three distinct high-walled boxes. Most cells had distinctive firing fields in each box. A runway was then added to connect two initially unrelated boxes. This manipulation altered the firing of some cells but the fields in each box were still clearly distinguishable. The final manipulation consisted of changing one box and allowing the rat to commute freely between the changed and unchanged boxes. While the firing fields remapped in the changed box, they were most usually unaltered in the unchanged box. These results suggest that the hippocampus holds a set of independent maps for each box, and that each specific map is activated mainly according to the rat's current sensory environment.",,,,,,,,,"Paz-Villagr{\'a}n, V. and Save, E. and Poucet, B.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-21 12:16:13 +0100,2020-12-21 12:16:40 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03570.x,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03570.x,,,,,,,,,European Journal of Neuroscience,,,"hippocampus, place cells, rat, spatial context, unit recordings",,,,,,,,,,,5,,,1379-1390,,,,,,,,,,,,Independent coding of connected environments by place cells,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03570.x,20,2004,

Most importantly, we found that the amount of hippocampal activity expressed during slow wave sleep positively correlates with the improvement of performance in route retrieval on the next day.

The workflow leverages established tools and practices from software engineering. It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), the analysis exactly reproduces at a later time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible.  While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility.

article,Peirce2008FN,"PsychoPy is a software library written in Python, using OpenGL to generate very precise visual stimuli on standard personal computers. It is designed to allow the construction of as wide a variety of neuroscience experiments as possible, with the least effort. By writing scripts in standard Python syntax users can generate an enormous variety of visual and auditory stimuli and can interact with a wide range of external hardware (enabling its use in fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.). The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive.

Here we describe the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its development. The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility.

Here we propose that precisely coordinated representations across brain regions allow the inference and evaluation of causal relationships to train an internal generative model of the world. This training starts during wakefulness and strongly benefits from sleep because its recurring nested oscillations may reflect compositional operations that facilitate a hierarchical processing of information, potentially including behavioral policy evaluations. This suggests that an important function of sleep activity is to provide conditions conducive to general inference, prediction and insight, which contribute to a more robust internal model that underlies generalization and adaptive behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Penagos, Hector and Varela, Carmen and Wilson, Matthew A",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAcLi4vcGFwZXJzL3BlbmFnb3MyMDE3Y29uLnBkZk8RAXQAAAAAAXQAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////xJwZW5hZ29zMjAxN2Nvbi5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAQS86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6cGVuYWdvczIwMTdjb24ucGRmAAAOACYAEgBwAGUAbgBhAGcAbwBzADIAMAAxADcAYwBvAG4ALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA/VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvcGVuYWdvczIwMTdjb24ucGRmAAATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABDAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbs=,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-07 16:24:29 +0200,2020-04-07 16:25:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.conb.2017.05.009,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-4388,,,Current Opinion in Neurobiology,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,193--201,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,replay; review,,"Oscillations, neural computations and learning during wake and sleep",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2017.05.009,44,2017,

article,Penn2008BBS,"Over the last quarter century, the dominant tendency in comparative cognitive psychology has been to emphasize the similarities between human and nonhuman minds and to downplay the differences as ``one of degree and not of kind'' (Darwin 1871). In the present target article, we argue that Darwin was mistaken: the profound biological continuity between human and nonhuman animals masks an equally profound discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. To wit, there is a significant discontinuity in the degree to which human and nonhuman animals are able to approximate the higher-order, systematic, relational capabilities of a physical symbol system (PSS) (Newell 1980). We show that this symbolic-relational discontinuity pervades nearly every domain of cognition and runs much deeper than even the spectacular scaffolding provided by language or culture alone can explain. We propose a representational-level specification as to where human and nonhuman animals' abilities to approximate a PSS are similar and where they differ. We conclude by suggesting that recent symbolic-connectionist models of cognition shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie the gap between human and nonhuman minds.",,,,,,,,,"Penn, Derek C. and Holyoak, Keith J. and Povinelli, Daniel J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-08 14:19:45 +0200,2020-05-08 14:20:19 +0200,,,10.1017/s0140525x08003543,,,,,,,,,,,,1469-1825,,,Behavioral and Brain Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,2,,,109--130,,,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,,,,,,,Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X08003543,31,2008,
article,Pennartz2004JN,"Previously it has been shown that the hippocampus and neocortex can spontaneously reactivate ensemble activity patterns during post-behavioral sleep and rest periods. Here we examined whether such reactivation also occurs in a subcortical structure, the ventral striatum, which receives a direct input from the hippocampal formation and has been implicated in guidance of consummatory and conditioned behaviors. During a reward-searching task on a T-maze, flanked by sleep and rest periods, parallel recordings were made from ventral striatal ensembles while EEG signals were derived from the hippocampus. Statistical measures indicated a significant amount of reactivation in the ventral striatum. In line with hippocampal data, reactivation was especially prominent during post-behavioral slow-wave sleep, but unlike the hippocampus, no decay in pattern recurrence was visible in the ventral striatum across the first 40 min of post-behavioral rest. We next studied the relationship between ensemble firing patterns in ventral striatum and hippocampal ripples-sharp waves, which have been implicated in pattern replay. Firing rates were significantly modulated in close temporal association with hippocampal ripples in 25% of the units, showing a marked transient enhancement in the average response profile. Strikingly, ripple-modulated neurons in ventral striatum showed a clear reactivation, whereas nonmodulated cells did not. These data suggest, first, the occurrence of pattern replay in a subcortical structure implied in the processing and prediction of reward and, second, a functional linkage between ventral striatal reactivation and a specific type of high-frequency population activity associated with hippocampal replay.",,,,,,,,,"Pennartz, C.

First, does conscious experience necessarily depend on acute interactions between a subject and the environment? Second, does it depend on specific perception--action loops in the longer run? Third, which types of action does consciousness cohere with, if not with all of them? I argue that conscious contents do not necessarily depend on acute or long-term brain--environment interactions. Instead, consciousness is proposed to be specifically associated with, and subserve, deliberate, goal-directed behavior (GDB).

article,Penny2013PCB,"The ability of mammals to navigate is well studied, both behaviourally and in terms on the underlying neurophysiology. Navigation is a well studied topic in computational fields such as machine learning and signal processing. However, studies in computational neuroscience, which draw together these findings, have mainly focused on specific navigation tasks such as spatial localisation. In this paper, we propose a single probabilistic model which can support multiple tasks, from working out which environment you are in, to computing a sequence of motor commands that will take you to a sensory goal, such as being warm or viewing a particular object. We describe how these tasks can be implemented using a common set of lower level algorithms that implement `forward and backward inference over time'. We relate these algorithms to recent findings in animal electrophysiology, where sequences of hippocampal cell activations are observed before, during or after a navigation task, and these sequences are played either forwards or backwards. Additionally, one function of the hippocampus that is preserved across mammals is that it integrates spatial and non-spatial information, and we propose how the forward and backward inference algorithms naturally map onto this architecture.",,,,,,,,,"Penny, Will D. and Zeidman, Peter and Burgess, Neil",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 13:24:23 +0100,2020-11-30 13:25:10 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLoS Computational Biology,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,12,,,1-22,,,,Public Library of Science,,,,,,,,Forward and Backward Inference in Spatial Cognition,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003383,9,2013,

In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of `is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely `where is the information' (pattern localization) and `how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).",,,,,,,,,"Pereira, Francisco and Mitchell, Tom and Botvinick, Matthew",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-24 14:38:05 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.11.007,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,1,,,S199--S209,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,MRI; methods,,Machine learning classifiers and {fMRI}: A tutorial overview,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.11.007,45,2009,
article,Pereira2020NN,"Over the past years, numerous methods have emerged to automate the quantification of animal behavior at a resolution not previously imaginable. This has opened up a new field of computational ethology and will, in the near future, make it possible to quantify in near completeness what an animal is doing as it navigates its environment. The importance of improving the techniques with which we characterize behavior is reflected in the emerging recognition that understanding behavior is an essential (or even prerequisite) step to pursuing neuroscience questions. The use of these methods, however, is not limited to studying behavior in the wild or in strictly ethological settings. Modern tools for behavioral quantification can be applied to the full gamut of approaches that have historically been used to link brain to behavior, from psychophysics to cognitive tasks, augmenting those measurements with rich descriptions of how animals navigate those tasks. Here we review recent technical advances in quantifying behavior, particularly in methods for tracking animal motion and characterizing the structure of those dynamics. We discuss open challenges that remain for behavioral quantification and highlight promising future directions, with a strong emphasis on emerging approaches in deep learning, the core technology that has enabled the markedly rapid pace of progress of this field.

Spontaneous episodic imagery during cue processing predicted how much subjects changed their preferences toward more future-minded choice behavior. Neural valuation signals in the anterior cingulate cortex and functional coupling of this region with hippocampus and amygdala predicted the degree to which future thinking modulated individual preference functions.

article,Peyrache2011PNAS,"During light slow-wave sleep, the thalamo-cortical network oscillates in waxing-and-waning patterns at about 7 to 14 Hz and lasting for 500 ms to 3 s, called spindles, with the thalamus rhythmically sending strong excitatory volleys to the cortex. Concurrently, the hippocampal activity is characterized by transient and strong excitatory events, Sharp-Waves-Ripples (SPWRs), directly affecting neocortical activity{\textemdash}in particular the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC){\textemdash}which receives monosynaptic fibers from the ventral hippocampus and subiculum. Both spindles and SPWRs have been shown to be strongly involved in memory consolidation. However, the dynamics of the cortical network during natural sleep spindles and how prefrontal circuits simultaneously process hippocampal and thalamo-cortical activity remain largely undetermined. Using multisite neuronal recordings in rat mPFC, we show that during sleep spindles, oscillatory responses of cortical cells are different for different cell types and cortical layers. Superficial neurons are more phase-locked and tonically recruited during spindle episodes. Moreover, in a given layer, interneurons were always more modulated than pyramidal cells, both in firing rate and phase, suggesting that the dynamics are dominated by inhibition. In the deep layers, where most of the hippocampal fibers make contacts, pyramidal cells respond phasically to SPWRs, but not during spindles. Similar observations were obtained when analyzing γ-oscillation modulation in the mPFC. These results demonstrate that during sleep spindles, the cortex is functionnaly {\textquotedblleft}deafferented{\textquotedblright} from its hippocampal inputs, based on processes of cortical origin, and presumably mediated by the strong recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. The interplay between hippocampal and thalamic inputs may underlie a global mechanism involved in the consolidation of recently formed memory traces.",,,,,,,,,"Peyrache, Adrien and Battaglia, Francesco P. and Destexhe, Alain",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-20 15:16:23 +0100,2021-01-20 15:16:42 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1103612108,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/41/17207.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,,,17207--17212,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Inhibition recruitment in prefrontal cortex during sleep spindles and gating of hippocampal inputs,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/41/17207,108,2011,

One possible reason for this is that such replay exchanges information between hippocampus and neocortex, supporting consolidation. We recorded neuron ensembles in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to study memory trace reactivation during SWS following learning and execution of cross-modal strategy shifts. In general, reactivation of learning-related patterns occurred in distinct, highly synchronized transient bouts, mostly simultaneous with hippocampal sharp wave/ripple complexes (SPWRs), when hippocampal ensemble reactivation and cortico-hippocampal interaction is enhanced. During sleep following learning of a new rule, mPFC neural patterns that appeared during response selection replayed prominently, coincident with hippocampal SPWRs. This was learning dependent, as the patterns appeared only after rule acquisition.

article,Pezzulo2017AYAS,"Information processing in the rodent hippocampus is fundamentally shaped by internally generated sequences (IGSs), expressed during two different network states: theta sequences, which repeat and reset at the ∼8 Hz theta rhythm associated with active behavior, and punctate sharp wave‐ripple (SWR) sequences associated with wakeful rest or slow‐wave sleep. A potpourri of diverse functional roles has been proposed for these IGSs, resulting in a fragmented conceptual landscape. Here, we advance a unitary view of IGSs, proposing that they reflect an inferential process that samples a policy from the animal's generative model, supported by hippocampus‐specific priors. The same inference affords different cognitive functions when the animal is in distinct dynamical modes, associated with specific functional networks. Theta sequences arise when inference is coupled to the animal's action--perception cycle, supporting online spatial decisions, predictive processing, and episode encoding. SWR sequences arise when the animal is decoupled from the action--perception cycle and may support offline cognitive processing, such as memory consolidation, the prospective simulation of spatial trajectories, and imagination.

Here we provide evidence for autoassociative dynamics in sequence generation. During sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, hippocampal neurons express sequenced reactivations, which we show are composed of discrete attractors. Each attractor corresponds to a single location, the representation of which sharpens over the course of several milliseconds, as the reactivation focuses at that location. Subsequently, the reactivation transitions rapidly to a spatially discontiguous location. This alternation between sharpening and transition occurs repeatedly within individual SWRs and is locked to the slow-gamma (25 to 50 hertz) rhythm.

article,Pfeiffer2018H,"One of the most striking features of the hippocampal network is its ability to self‐generate neuronal sequences representing temporally compressed, spatially coherent paths. These brief events, often termed ``replay'' in the scientific literature, are largely confined to non‐exploratory states such as sleep or quiet rest. Early studies examining the content of replay noted a strong correlation between the encoded spatial information and the animal's prior behavior; thus, replay was initially hypothesized to play a role in memory formation and/or systems‐level consolidation via ``off‐line'' reactivation of previous experiences. However, recent findings indicate that replay may also serve as a memory retrieval mechanism to guide future behavior or may be an incidental reflection of pre‐existing network assemblies. Here, I will review what is known regarding the content of replay events and their correlation with past and future actions, and I will discuss how this knowledge might inform or constrain models which seek to explain the circuit‐level mechanisms underlying these events and their role in mnemonic processes.",,,,,,,,,"Pfeiffer, Brad E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-01 12:03:01 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1002/hipo.22824,,,,,,,,,,,,1050-9631,,,Hippocampus,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,,,,1--13,,,,Wiley,,,,,,"replay, review",,The content of hippocampal {``replay''},,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22824,,2018,
article,Pfeiffer2013N,"Effective navigation requires planning extended routes to remembered goal locations. Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as `replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.",,,,,,,,,"Pfeiffer, Brad E. and Foster, David J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-10-04 16:35:35 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/nature12112,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,7447,,,74--79,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Hippocampal place-cell sequences depict future paths to remembered goals,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12112,497,2013,

article,Phillips2012N,"Rhythmic neural network activity patterns are defining features of sleep, but interdependencies between limbic and cortical oscillations at different frequencies and their functional roles have not been fully resolved. This is particularly important given evidence linking abnormal sleep architecture and memory consolidation in psychiatric diseases. Using EEG, local field potential (LFP), and unit recordings in rats, we show that anteroposterior propagation of neocortical slow-waves coordinates timing of hippocampal ripples and prefrontal cortical spindles during NREM sleep. This coordination is selectively disrupted in a rat neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: fragmented NREM sleep and impaired slow-wave propagation in the model culminate in deficient ripple-spindle coordination and disrupted spike timing, potentially as a consequence of interneuronal abnormalities reflected by reduced parvalbumin expression. These data further define the interrelationships among slow-wave, spindle, and ripple events, indicating that sleep disturbances may be associated with state-dependent decoupling of hippocampal and cortical circuits in psychiatric diseases.",,,,,,,,,"Phillips, Keith G. and Bartsch, Ullrich and McCarthy, Andrew P. and Edgar, Dale M. and Tricklebank, Mark D. and Wafford, Keith A. and Jones, Matt W.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-20 15:27:22 +0100,2021-01-20 15:27:41 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.016,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,526 - 533,,,,,,,,,,,,Decoupling of Sleep-Dependent Cortical and Hippocampal Interactions in a Neurodevelopmental Model of Schizophrenia,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312008513,76,2012,

article,Plonsky2015PR,"Many behavioral phenomena, including underweighting of rare events and probability matching, can be the product of a tendency to rely on small samples of experiences. Why would small samples be used, and which experiences are likely to be included in these samples? Previous studies suggest that a cognitively efficient reliance on the most recent experiences can be very effective. We explore a very different and more cognitively demanding process explaining the tendency to rely on small samples: exploitation of environmental regularities. The first part of our study shows that across wide classes of dynamic binary choice environments, focusing only on experiences that followed the same sequence of outcomes preceding the current task is more effective than focusing on the most recent experiences. The second part of our study examines the psychological significance of these sequence-based rules. It shows that these tractable rules reproduce well-known indications of sensitivity to sequences and predict a nontrivial wavy recency effect of rare events. Analysis of published data supports this wavy recency prediction, but suggests an even wavier effect than these sequence-based rules predict. This pattern, and the main behavioral phenomena documented in basic decisions from experience and probability learning tasks, can be captured with a similarity-based model assuming that people follow sequences of outcomes most of the time but sometimes respond to trends.

article,Poldrack2001N,"Learning and memory in humans rely upon several memory systems, which appear to have dissociable brain substrates1,2. A fundamental question concerns whether, and how, these memory systems interact. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) that these memory systems may compete with each other during classification learning in humans. The medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia were differently engaged across subjects during classification learning depending upon whether the task emphasized declarative or nondeclarative memory, even when the to-be-learned material and the level of performance did not differ. Consistent with competition between memory systems suggested by animal studies3,4 and neuroimaging5, activity in these regions was negatively correlated across individuals. Further examination of classification learning using event-related FMRI showed rapid modulation of activity in these regions at the beginning of learning, suggesting that subjects relied upon the medial temporal lobe early in learning.

article,Poppenk2013TCS,"Investigation of the hippocampus has historically focused on computations within the trisynaptic circuit. However, discovery of important anatomical and functional variability along its long axis has inspired recent proposals of long-axis functional specialization in both the animal and human literatures. Here, we review and evaluate these proposals. We suggest that various long-axis specializations arise out of differences between the anterior (aHPC) and posterior hippocampus (pHPC) in large-scale network connectivity, the organization of entorhinal grid cells, and subfield compositions that bias the aHPC and pHPC towards pattern completion and separation, respectively. The latter two differences give rise to a property, reflected in the expression of multiple other functional specializations, of coarse, global representations in anterior hippocampus and fine-grained, local representations in posterior hippocampus.",,,,,,,,,"Poppenk, Jordan and Evensmoen, Hallvard R. and Moscovitch, Morris and Nadel, Lynn",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 16:29:45 +0100,2021-01-27 16:30:20 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.03.005,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6613,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,230 - 240,,,,,,,,,,,,Long-axis specialization of the human hippocampus,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661313000673,17,2013,
article,Port1987PB,"The role of the hippocampus in the association of two conditional stimuli was evaluated using the conditioned rabbit NM preparation and a sensory preconditioning paradigm. Multiple-unit activity was recorded from field CA1 during preconditioning. Paired presentations of CS1 and CS2 resulted in increased excitability which was highly correlated with later preformance during CS2 test sessions. Unpaired presentations evoked a response to stimulus onset often followed by an inhibitory period. Bilateral kainic acid lesions of CA1 had no deleterious effect on traditional CS-US conditioning but abolished the association of CS1 and CS2. These data suggest that the hippocampus may be vital to the association of sensory events.

article,Poulter2020NN,"Successfully navigating in physical or semantic space requires a neural representation of allocentric (map-based) vectors to boundaries, objects and goals. Cognitive processes such as path-planning and imagination entail the recall of vector representations, but evidence of neuron-level memory for allocentric vectors has been lacking. Here, we describe a novel neuron type, vector trace cell (VTC), whose firing generates a new vector field when a cue is encountered and a `trace'version of that field for hours after cue removal. VTCs are concentrated in subiculum, distal to CA1. Compared to non-trace cells, VTCs fire at further distances from cues and exhibit earlier-going shifts in preferred theta phase in response to newly introduced cues, which demonstrates a theta-linked neural substrate for memory encoding. VTCs suggest a vector-based model of computing spatial relationships between an agent and multiple spatial objects, or between different objects, freed from the constraints of direct perception of those objects.",,,,,,,,,"Poulter, Steven and Lee, Sang Ah and Dachtler, James and Wills, Thomas J. and Lever, Colin",,,,,,,,,,,2020/12/21,,2021-01-27 16:14:42 +0100,2021-01-27 16:14:42 +0100,,,10.1038/s41593-020-00761-w,,,,,,,,,Poulter2020,,1546-1726,,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vector trace cells in the subiculum of the hippocampal formation,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00761-w,,2020,
article,Powell1998AN,"Many different procedures have been proposed for optimization calculations when first derivatives are not available. Further, several researchers have contributed to the subject, including some who wish to prove convergence theorems, and some who wish to make any reduction in the least calculated value of the objective function. There is not even a key idea that can be used as a foundation of a review, except for the problem itself, which is the adjustment of variables so that a function becomes least, where each value of the function is returned by a subroutine for each trial vector of variables. Therefore the paper is a collection of essays on particular strategies and algorithms, in order to consider the advantages, limitations and theory of several techniques. The subjects addressed are line search methods, the restriction of vectors of variables to discrete grids, the use of geometric simplices, conjugate direction procedures, trust region algorithms that form linear or quadratic approximations to the objective function, and simulated annealing. We study the main features of the methods themselves, instead of providing a catalogue of references to published work, because an understanding of these features may be very helpful to future research.",,,,,,,,,"Powell, M.

article,Powell2007DAMTP,"The NEWUOA software is described briefly, with some numerical results that show good efficiency and accuracy in the unconstrained minimization without derivatives of functions of up to 320 variables. Some preliminary work on an extension of NEWUOA that allows simple bounds on the variables is also described. It suggests a variation of a technique in NEWUOA for maintaining adequate linear independence in the interpolation conditions that are used, which leads to five versions of the technique including the original one. Numerical experiments suggest that the new versions have some merit, but the details of the calculations are influenced strongly by computer rounding errors. The dependence of the number of iterations on the number of interpolation conditions is also investigated numerically. A surprising case with n=160 is found, n being the number of variables, where the number of iterations is reduced when the number of conditions is decreased from 2n+1 to n+6.

article,Power2014N,"Head motion systematically alters correlations in resting state functional connectivity fMRI (RSFC). In this report we examine impact of motion on signal intensity and RSFC correlations. We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10 s after motion ceases. These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects.",,,,,,,,,"Power, Jonathan D. and Mitra, Anish and Laumann, Timothy O. and Snyder, Abraham Z. and Schlaggar, Bradley L. and Petersen, Steven E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-13 16:22:02 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,,,,320--341,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,fmriprep,,"Methods to detect, characterize, and remove motion artifact in resting state fMRI",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048,84,2014,
article,Press2020TCS,"From the noisy information bombarding our senses, our brains must construct percepts that are veridical -- reflecting the true state of the world -- and informative -- conveying what we did not already know. Influential theories suggest that both challenges are met through mechanisms that use expectations about the likely state of the world to shape perception. However, current models explaining how expectations render perception either veridical or informative are mutually incompatible. While the former propose that perceptual experiences are dominated by events we expect, the latter propose that perception of expected events is suppressed. To solve this paradox we propose a two-process model in which probabilistic knowledge initially biases perception towards what is likely and subsequently upweights events that are particularly surprising.",,,,,,,,,"Press, Clare and Kok, Peter and Yon, Daniel",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-30 22:37:38 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1016/j.tics.2019.11.003,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6613,,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,1,,,13--24,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,The Perceptual Prediction Paradox,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.11.003,24,2020,
article,Preuschoff2011FN,"Our decisions are guided by the rewards we expect. These expectations are often based on incomplete knowledge and are thus subject to uncertainty. While the neurophysiology of expected rewards is well understood, less is known about the physiology of uncertainty. We hypothesize that uncertainty, or more specifically errors in judging uncertainty, are reflected in pupil dilation, a marker that has frequently been associated with decision making, but so far has remained largely elusive to quantitative models. To test this hypothesis, we measure pupil dilation while observers perform an auditory gambling task. This task dissociates two key decision variables -- uncertainty and reward -- and their errors from each other and from the act of the decision itself. We first demonstrate that the pupil does not signal expected reward or uncertainty per se, but instead signals surprise, that is, errors in judging uncertainty. While this general finding is independent of the precise quantification of these decision variables, we then analyze this effect with respect to a specific mathematical model of uncertainty and surprise, namely risk and risk prediction error. Using this quantification, we find that pupil dilation and risk prediction error are indeed highly correlated. Under the assumption of a tight link between noradrenaline (NA) and pupil size under constant illumination, our data may be interpreted as empirical evidence for the hypothesis that NA plays a similar role for uncertainty as dopamine does for reward, namely the encoding of error signals.",,,,,,,,,"Preuschoff, Kerstin",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-28 17:20:11 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.3389/fnins.2011.00115,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-453X,,,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,koenigsberg; noradrenaline; pupil dilation; pupillometry,,Pupil dilation signals surprise: evidence for noradrenaline's role in decision making,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2011.00115,5,2011,

article,Pu2018N,"In rodents, hippocampal cell assemblies formed during learning of a navigation task are observed to re-emerge during resting (offline) periods, accompanied by high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). This phenomenon is believed to reflect mechanisms for strengthening newly-formed memory traces. Using magnetoencephalography recordings and a beamforming source location algorithm (synthetic aperture magnetometry), we investigated high-gamma (80--140 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampal region in 18 human participants during inter-trial rest periods in a virtual navigation task. We found right hippocampal gamma oscillations mirrored the pattern of theta power in the same region during navigation, varying as a function of environmental novelty. Gamma power during inter-trial rest periods was positively correlated with theta power during navigation in the first task set when the environment was new and predicted greater performance improvement in the subsequent task set two where the environment became familiar.

article,Pulcu2017E,"Affective bias, the tendency to differentially prioritise the processing of negative relative to positive events, is commonly observed in clinical and non-clinical populations. However, why such biases develop is not known. Using a computational framework, we investigated whether affective biases may reflect individuals' estimates of the information content of negative relative to positive events. During a reinforcement learning task, the information content of positive and negative outcomes was manipulated independently by varying the volatility of their occurrence. Human participants altered the learning rates used for the outcomes selectively, preferentially learning from the most informative. This behaviour was associated with activity of the central norepinephrine system, estimated using pupilometry, for loss outcomes. Humans maintain independent estimates of the information content of distinct positive and negative outcomes which may bias their processing of affective events. Normalising affective biases using computationally inspired interventions may represent a novel approach to treatment development.",,,,,,,,,"Pulcu, Erdem and Browning, Michael",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-28 09:38:05 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.7554/elife.27879,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,Affective bias as a rational response to the statistics of rewards and punishments,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27879,6,2017,

article,Qian2014PNAS,"The effects of stimulus order on human cognition have been previously reported in various cognitive tasks, and the prevalent explanations have been that sensitivity to stimulus order is due to either constraints on cognitive resources (e.g., working memory) or misconceptions about probability axioms. Our work suggests a fundamentally different interpretation: Humans are sensitive to order because it serves as an important cue. This interpretation is philosophically consistent with the burgeoning literature on rational cognition, where human behavior has been shown to (at least approximately) match the statistically optimal solution of a task. We propose that redefining the role of stimulus order as a cue may provide a more general perspective for understanding human cognition.The order in which stimuli are presented in an experiment has long been recognized to influence behavior. Previous accounts have often attributed the effect of stimulus order to the mechanisms with which people process information. We propose that stimulus order influences cognition because it is an important cue for learning the underlying structure of a task environment. In particular, stimulus order can be used to infer a {\textquotedblleft}stimulus bundle{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}a sequence of consecutive stimuli that share the same underlying latent cluster. We describe a clustering model that successfully explains the perception of streak shooting in basketball games, along with two other cognitive phenomena, as the outcome of finding the statistically optimal bundle representation. We argue that the perspective of viewing stimulus order as a cue may hold the key to explaining behaviors that seemingly deviate from normative theories of cognition and that in task domains where the assumption of stimulus bundles is intuitively appropriate, it can improve the explanatory power of existing models.",,,,,,,,,"Qian, Ting and Aslin, Richard N.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 14:23:28 +0100,2020-10-29 14:23:55 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1416109111,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/111/40/14400.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,,,14400--14405,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,"Learning bundles of stimuli renders stimulus order as a cue, not a confound",,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/111/40/14400,111,2014,
article,Qin1997PTRSLSBS,"Hippocampal cells that fire together during behaviour exhibit enhanced activity correlations during subsequent sleep, with some preservation of temporal order information. Thus, information reflecting experiences during behaviour is re--expressed in hippocampal circuits during subsequent `offline' periods, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation. If the hippocampus orchestrates the reinstatement of experience--specific activity patterns in the neocortex, as also postulated by such theories, then correlation patterns both within the neocortex and between hippocampus and neocortex should also re--emerge during sleep. Ensemble recordings were made in the posterior parietal neocortex, in CA1, and simultaneously in both areas, in seven rats. Each session involved an initial sleep episode (S1), behaviour on a simple maze (M), and subsequent sleep (S2). The ensemble activity--correlation structure within and between areas during S2 resembled that of M more closely than did the correlation pattern of S1. Temporal order (i.e. the asymmetry of the cross--correlogram) was also preserved within, but not between, structures. Thus, traces of recent experience are re--expressed in both hippocampal and neocortical circuits during sleep, and the representations in the two areas tend to correspond to the same experience. The poorer preservation of temporal firing biases between neurons in the different regions may reflect the less direct synaptic coupling between regions than within them. Alternatively, it could result from a shift, between behavioural states, in the relative dominance relations in the corticohippocampal dialogue. Between--structure order will be disrupted, for example, if, during behaviour, neocortical patterns tend to drive corresponding hippocampal patterns, whereas during sleep the reverse occurs. This possibility remains to be investigated.",,,,,,,,,"Qin, Yu-Lin and Mcnaughton, Bruce L. and Skaggs, William E. and Barnes, Carol A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 14:20:29 +0200,2020-04-15 14:21:06 +0200,,,10.1098/rstb.1997.0139,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2970,,,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

article,Quentin2020B,"Knowing when the brain learns is crucial for both the comprehension of memory formation and consolidation, and for developing new training and neurorehabilitation strategies in healthy and patient populations. Recently, a rapid form of offline learning developing during short rest periods has been shown to account for most of procedural learning, leading to the hypothesis that the brain mainly learns during rest between practice periods. Nonetheless, procedural learning has several subcomponents not disentangled in previous studies investigating learning dynamics, such as acquiring the statistical regularities of the task, or else the high-order rules that regulate its organization. Here, we analyzed 506 behavioral sessions of implicit visuomotor deterministic and probabilistic sequence learning tasks, allowing the distinction between general skill learning, statistical learning and high-order rule learning. Our results show that the temporal dynamics of apparently simultaneous learning processes differ. While general skill and high-order rule learning are acquired offline, statistical learning is evidenced online. These findings open new avenues on the short-scale temporal dynamics of learning and memory consolidation and reveal a fundamental distinction between statistical and high-order rule learning, the former benefiting from online evidence accumulation and the latter requiring short rest periods for rapid consolidation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Quentin, Romain and Fanuel, Lison and Kiss, Mariann and Vernet, Marine and Vekony, Teodora and Janacsek, Karolina and Cohen, Leonardo and Nemeth, Dezso",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 09:53:46 +0100,2020-10-26 09:54:20 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.10.25.353375,,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/25/2020.10.25.353375.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Statistical learning occurs during practice while high-order rule learning during rest period,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/25/2020.10.25.353375,,2020,

Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names.

article,Ramanathan2015PB,"Despite many prior studies demonstrating offline behavioral gains in motor skills after sleep, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. To investigate the neurophysiological basis for offline gains, we performed single-unit recordings in motor cortex as rats learned a skilled upper-limb task. We found that sleep improved movement speed with preservation of accuracy. These offline improvements were linked to both replay of task-related ensembles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements; such offline gains and temporal shifts were not evident with sleep restriction. Interestingly, replay was linked to the coincidence of slow-wave events and bursts of spindle activity. Neurons that experienced the most consistent replay also underwent the most significant temporal shift and binding to the motor task. Significantly, replay and the associated performance gains after sleep only occurred when animals first learned the skill; continued practice during later stages of learning (i.e., after motor kinematics had stabilized) did not show evidence of replay.

article,Ramicic2020N,"Online reinforcement learning agents are now able to process an increasing amount of data which makes their approximation and compression into value functions a more demanding task. To improve approximation, thus the learning process itself, it has been proposed to select randomly a mini-batch of the past experiences that are stored in the replay memory buffer to be replayed at each learning step. In this work, we present an algorithm that classifies and samples the experiences into separate contextual memory buffers using an unsupervised learning technique. This allows each new experience to be associated to a mini-batch of the past experiences that are not from the same contextual buffer as the current one, thus further reducing the correlation between experiences. Experimental results show that the correlation minimizing sampling improves over Q-learning algorithms with uniform sampling, and that a significant improvement can be observed when coupled with the sampling methods that prioritize on the experience temporal difference error.",,,,,,,,,"Ramicic, Mirza and Bonarini, Andrea",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-08 15:00:51 +0200,2020-11-30 16:57:33 +0100,,,10.1016/j.neucom.2020.02.004,,,,,,,,,,,,0925-2312,,,Neurocomputing,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,91--100,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Correlation minimizing replay memory in temporal-difference reinforcement learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.02.004,393,2020,
article,Ramirez2013S,"Being highly imaginative animals, humans constantly recall past experiences. These internally generated stimuli sometimes get associated with concurrent external stimuli, which can lead to the formation of false memories. Ramirez et al. (p. 387; see the cover) identified a population of cells in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus that encoded a particular context and were able to generate a false memory and study its neural and behavioral interactions with true memories. Optogenetic reactivation of memory engram{\textendash}bearing cells was not only sufficient for the behavioral recall of that memory, but could also serve as a conditioned stimulus for the formation of an associative memory. Memories can be unreliable. We created a false memory in mice by optogenetically manipulating memory engram{\textendash}bearing cells in the hippocampus. Dentate gyrus (DG) or CA1 neurons activated by exposure to a particular context were labeled with channelrhodopsin-2. These neurons were later optically reactivated during fear conditioning in a different context. The DG experimental group showed increased freezing in the original context, in which a foot shock was never delivered. The recall of this false memory was context-specific, activated similar downstream regions engaged during natural fear memory recall, and was also capable of driving an active fear response.

Animal models can exhibit limited but quantifiable behavioural impairments resulting from chronic stress, including deficits in motivation, abnormal responses to behavioural challenges, and anhedonia3,4,5. The hippocampus is thought to negatively regulate the stress response and to mediate various cognitive and mnemonic aspects of stress-induced impairments2,3,5, although the neuronal underpinnings sufficient to support behavioural improvements are largely unknown. Here we acutely rescue stress-induced depression-related behaviours in mice by optogenetically reactivating dentate gyrus cells that were previously active during a positive experience. A brain-wide histological investigation, coupled with pharmacological and projection-specific optogenetic blockade experiments, identified glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus--amygdala--nucleus-accumbens pathway as a candidate circuit supporting the acute rescue. Finally, chronically reactivating hippocampal cells associated with a positive memory resulted in the rescue of stress-induced behavioural impairments and neurogenesis at time points beyond the light stimulation. Together, our data suggest that activating positive memories artificially is sufficient to suppress depression-like behaviours and point to dentate gyrus engram cells as potential therapeutic nodes for intervening with maladaptive behavioural states.",,,,,,,,,"Ramirez, Steve and Liu, Xu and MacDonald, Christopher J. and Moffa, Anthony and Zhou, Joanne and Redondo, Roger L. and Tonegawa, Susumu",,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,,,,,,,,,2015/06/01,,2020-12-22 11:05:45 +0100,2020-12-22 11:06:24 +0100,,,10.1038/nature14514,,,,,,,,,Ramirez2015,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7556,,,335--339,,,,,,,,,,,,Activating positive memory engrams suppresses depression-like behaviour,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14514,522,2015,
article,Ramirez-Villegas2018N,"Hippocampal ripple oscillations likely support reactivation of memory traces that manifest themselves as temporally organized spiking of sparse neuronal ensembles. However, the network mechanisms concurring to achieve this function are largely unknown. We designed a multi-compartmental model of the CA3-CA1 subfields to generate biophysically realistic ripple dynamics from the cellular level to local field potentials. Simulations broadly parallel in vivo observations and support that ripples emerge from CA1 pyramidal spiking paced by recurrent inhibition. In addition to ripple oscillations, key coordination mechanisms involve concomitant aspects of network activity. Recurrent synaptic interactions in CA1 exhibit slow-gamma band coherence with CA3 input, thus offering a way to coordinate CA1 activities with CA3 inducers. Moreover, CA1 feedback inhibition controls the content of spontaneous replay during CA1 ripples, forming new mnemonic representations through plasticity. These insights are consistent with slow-gamma interactions and interneuronal circuit plasticity observed in vivo, suggesting a multifaceted ripple-related replay phenomenon.",,,,,,,,,"Ramirez-Villegas, Juan F. and Willeke, Konstantin F. and Logothetis, Nikos K. and Besserve, Michel",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 18:41:18 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.041,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,5,,,1224--1240.e13,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Dissecting the Synapse- and Frequency-Dependent Network Mechanisms of In Vivo Hippocampal Sharp Wave-Ripples,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.041,100,2018,

article,Rasch2007CON,"According to a widely held concept, the formation of long-term memories relies on a reactivation and redistribution of newly acquired memory representations from temporary storage to neuronal networks supporting long-term storage. Here, we review evidence showing that this process of system consolidation takes place preferentially during sleep as an `off-line' period during which memories are spontaneously reactivated and redistributed in the absence of interfering external inputs. Moreover, postlearning sleep leads to a reorganization of neuronal representations and qualitative changes of memory content. We propose that memory reactivations during sleep are accompanied by a transient destabilization of memory traces.

article,Rasch2013PR,"Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of ``sleep and memory'' research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems.",,,,,,,,,"Rasch, Bj{\""o}rn and Born, Jan",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-20 07:43:47 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1152/physrev.00032.2012,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-1210,,,Physiological Reviews,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,2,,,681--766,,,,American Physiological Society,,,,,,sleep; consolidation;,,About Sleep's Role in Memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00032.2012,93,2013,

article,Reber2012JN,"Relational inference denotes the capacity to encode, flexibly retrieve, and integrate multiple memories to combine past experiences to update knowledge and improve decision-making in new situations. Although relational inference is thought to depend on the hippocampus and consciousness, we now show in young, healthy men that it may occur outside consciousness but still recruits the hippocampus. In temporally distinct and unique subliminal episodes, we presented word pairs that either overlapped ({\textquotedblleft}winter{\textendash}red{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}red{\textendash}computer{\textquotedblright}) or not. Effects of unconscious relational inference emerged in reaction times recorded during unconscious encoding and in the outcome of decisions made 1 min later at test, when participants judged the semantic relatedness of two supraliminal words. These words were either episodically related through a common word ({\textquotedblleft}winter{\textendash}computer{\textquotedblright} related through {\textquotedblleft}red{\textquotedblright}) or unrelated.

article,Reddy2020B,"An indispensable feature of episodic memory is our ability to temporally piece together different elements of an experience into a coherent memory. Hippocampal time cells, neurons that represent temporal information, may play a critical role in this process. While these cells have been repeatedly found in rodents, it is still unclear to what extent similar temporal selectivity exists in the human hippocampus. Here we show that temporal context modulates the firing activity of human hippocampal neurons during structured temporal experiences. We recorded neuronal activity in the human brain while patients learned predictable sequences of pictures. We report that human time cells fire at successive moments in this task. Furthermore, time cells also signaled inherently changing temporal contexts during empty 10-second gap periods between trials, while participants waited for the task to resume. Finally, population activity allowed for decoding temporal epoch identity, both during sequence learning and during the gap periods. These findings suggest that human hippocampal neurons could play an essential role in temporally organizing distinct moments of an experience in episodic memory.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Reddy, Leila and Zoefel, Benedikt and Possel, Jessy and Peters, Judith and Dijksterhuis, Doris and Poncet, Marlene and van Straaten, Elisabeth C.W. and Baayen, Johannes C and Idema, Sander and Self, Matthew W",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-18 13:55:19 +0100,2020-12-18 13:55:37 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.12.17.423193,,,,,2020.12.17.423193,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/17/2020.12.17.423193.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Human hippocampal neurons track moments in a sequence of events.,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/17/2020.12.17.423193,,2020,

article,Redish2016NRN,"When rats come to a decision point, they sometimes pause and look back and forth as if deliberating over the choice; at other times, they proceed as if they have already made their decision. In the 1930s, this pause-and-look behaviour was termed 'vicarious trial and error' (VTE), with the implication that the rat was 'thinking about the future'. The discovery in 2007 that the firing of hippocampal place cells gives rise to alternating representations of each of the potential path options in a serial manner during VTE suggested a possible neural mechanism that could underlie the representations of future outcomes. More-recent experiments examining VTE in rats suggest that there are direct parallels to human processes of deliberative decision making, working memory and mental time travel.",,,,,,,,,"Redish, A.

article,Redish2007PR,"Because learned associations are quickly renewed following extinction, the extinction process must include processes other than unlearning. However, reinforcement learning models, such as the temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) model, treat extinction as an unlearning of associated value and are thus unable to capture renewal. TDRL models are based on the hypothesis that dopamine carries a reward prediction error signal; these models predict reward by driving that reward error to zero. The authors construct a TDRL model that can accommodate extinction and renewal through two simple processes: (a) a TDRL process that learns the value of situation-action pairs and (b) a situation recognition process that categorizes the observed cues into situations.

article,Redish1998NC,"We suggest that the hippocampus plays two roles that allow rodents to solve the hidden-platform water maze: self-localization and route replay. When an animal explores an environment such as the water maze, the combination of place fields and correlational (Hebbian) long-term potentiation produces a weight matrix in the CA3 recurrent collaterals such that cells with overlapping place fields are more strongly interconnected than cells with nonoverlapping fields. When combined with global inhibition, this forms an attractor with coherent representations of position as stable states. When biased by local view information, this allows the animal to determine its position relative to the goal when it returns to the environment. We call this self-localization. When an animal traces specific routes within an environment, the weights in the CA3 recurrent collaterals become asymmetric. We show that this stores these routes in the recurrent collaterals. When primed with noise in the absence of sensory input, a coherent representation of position still forms in the CA3 population, but then that representation drifts, retracing a route. We show that these two mechanisms can coexist and form a basis for memory consolidation, explaining the anterograde and limited retrograde amnesia seen following hippocampal lesions.",,,,,,,,,"Redish, A.

article,Redondo2014N,"The valence of memories is malleable because of their intrinsic reconstructive property1. This property of memory has been used clinically to treat maladaptive behaviours2. However, the neuronal mechanisms and brain circuits that enable the switching of the valence of memories remain largely unknown. Here we investigated these mechanisms by applying the recently developed memory engram cell- manipulation technique3,4. We labelled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) a population of cells in either the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus or the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) that were specifically activated during contextual fear or reward conditioning. Both groups of fear-conditioned mice displayed aversive light-dependent responses in an optogenetic place avoidance test, whereas both DG- and BLA-labelled mice that underwent reward conditioning exhibited an appetitive response in an optogenetic place preference test. Next, in an attempt to reverse the valence of memory within a subject, mice whose DG or BLA engram had initially been labelled by contextual fear or reward conditioning were subjected to a second conditioning of the opposite valence while their original DG or BLA engram was reactivated by blue light. Subsequent optogenetic place avoidance and preference tests revealed that although the DG-engram group displayed a response indicating a switch of the memory valence, the BLA-engram group did not. This switch was also evident at the cellular level by a change in functional connectivity between DG engram-bearing cells and BLA engram-bearing cells. Thus, we found that in the DG, the neurons carrying the memory engram of a given neutral context have plasticity such that the valence of a conditioned response evoked by their reactivation can be reversed by re-associating this contextual memory engram with a new unconditioned stimulus of an opposite valence. Our present work provides new insight into the functional neural circuits underlying the malleability of emotional memory.",,,,,,,,,"Redondo, Roger L. and Kim, Joshua and Arons, Autumn L. and Ramirez, Steve and Liu, Xu and Tonegawa, Susumu",,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,,,,,,,,,2014/09/01,,2020-12-22 11:07:24 +0100,2020-12-22 11:07:53 +0100,,,10.1038/nature13725,,,,,,,,,Redondo2014,,1476-4687,,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7518,,,426--430,,,,,,,,,,,,Bidirectional switch of the valence associated with a hippocampal contextual memory engram,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13725,513,2014,
article,Reifenstein2020B,"Remembering the temporal order of a sequence of events is a task easily performed by humans in everyday life, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unclear. This problem is particularly intriguing as human behavior often proceeds on a time scale of seconds, which is in stark contrast to the much faster millisecond time-scale of neuronal processing in our brains. One long-held hypothesis in sequence learning suggests that a particular temporal fine-structure of neuronal activity---termed ``phase precession''---enables the compression of slow behavioral sequences down to the fast time scale of the induction of synaptic plasticity. Using mathematical analysis and computer simulations, we find that phase precession can improve sequence learning tremendously and that the asymmetric part of the synaptic learning window is essential for temporal-order learning. To test these predictions, we suggest experiments that selectively alter phase precession or the learning window and evaluate memory of temporal order.",,,,,,,,,"Reifenstein, Eric T. and Kempter, Richard",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-08 14:09:10 +0200,2020-05-08 14:09:38 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.04.13.039826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Synaptic learning rules for sequence learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.039826,,2020,
article,Retter2018VR,"Fast periodic visual stimulation combined with electroencephalography (FPVS-EEG) has unique sensitivity and objectivity in measuring rapid visual categorization processes. It constrains image processing time by presenting stimuli rapidly through brief stimulus presentation durations and short inter-stimulus intervals. However, the selective impact of these temporal parameters on visual categorization is largely unknown. Here, we presented natural images of objects at a rate of 10 or 20 per second (10 or 20 Hz), with faces appearing once per second (1 Hz), leading to two distinct frequency-tagged EEG responses. Twelve observers were tested with three squarewave image presentation conditions: 1) with an ISI, a traditional 50% duty cycle at 10 Hz (50-ms stimulus duration separated by a 50-ms ISI); 2) removing the ISI and matching the rate, a 100% duty cycle at 10 Hz (100-ms duration with 0-ms ISI); 3) removing the ISI and matching the stimulus presentation duration, a 100% duty cycle at 20 Hz (50-ms duration with 0-ms ISI). The face categorization response was significantly decreased in the 20 Hz 100% condition. The conditions at 10 Hz showed similar face-categorization responses, peaking maximally over the right occipito-temporal (ROT) cortex. However, the onset of the 10 Hz 100% response was delayed by about 20 ms over the ROT region relative to the 10 Hz 50% condition, likely due to immediate forward-masking by preceding images. Taken together, these results help to interpret how the FPVS-EEG paradigm sets temporal constraints on visual image categorization.",,,,,,,,,"Retter, Talia L. and Jiang, Fang and Webster, Michael A. and Rossion, Bruno",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-11 13:19:47 +0200,2020-08-11 13:20:30 +0200,,,10.1016/j.visres.2018.02.009,,,,,,,,,,,,0042-6989,,,Vision Research,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,11--20,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Dissociable effects of inter-stimulus interval and presentation duration on rapid face categorization,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2018.02.009,145,2018,
article,Reuter2010N,"The registration of images is a task that is at the core of many applications in computer vision. In computational neuroimaging where the automated segmentation of brain structures is frequently used to quantify change, a highly accurate registration is necessary for motion correction of images taken in the same session, or across time in longitudinal studies where changes in the images can be expected. This paper, inspired by Nestares and Heeger (2000), presents a method based on robust statistics to register images in the presence of differences, such as jaw movement, differential MR distortions and true anatomical change. The approach we present guarantees inverse consistency (symmetry), can deal with different intensity scales and automatically estimates a sensitivity parameter to detect outlier regions in the images. The resulting registrations are highly accurate due to their ability to ignore outlier regions and show superior robustness with respect to noise, to intensity scaling and outliers when compared to state-of-the-art registration tools such as FLIRT (in FSL) or the coregistration tool in SPM.",,,,,,,,,"Reuter, Martin and Rosas, H.

article,Reynolds2007CS,"People tend to perceive ongoing continuous activity as series of discrete events. This partitioning of continuous activity may occur, in part, because events correspond to dynamic patterns that have recurred across different contexts. Recurring patterns may lead to reliable sequential dependencies in observers' experiences, which then can be used to guide perception.

article,Ribas-Fernandes2011N,"Human behavior displays hierarchical structure: simple actions cohere into subtask sequences, which work together to accomplish overall task goals. Although the neural substrates of such hierarchy have been the target of increasing research, they remain poorly understood. We propose that the computations supporting hierarchical behavior may relate to those in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a machine-learning framework that extends reinforcement-learning mechanisms into hierarchical domains. To test this, we leveraged a distinctive prediction arising from HRL. In ordinary reinforcement learning, reward prediction errors are computed when there is an unanticipated change in the prospects for accomplishing overall task goals. HRL entails that prediction errors should also occur in relation to task subgoals. In three neuroimaging studies we observed neural responses consistent with such subgoal-related reward prediction errors, within structures previously implicated in reinforcement learning. The results reported support the relevance of HRL to the neural processes underlying hierarchical behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Ribas-Fernandes, Jos{\'e} J.F. and Solway, Alec and Diuk, Carlos and McGuire, Joseph T. and Barto, Andrew G. and Niv, Yael and Botvinick, Matthew M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-27 13:12:17 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.042,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,2,,,370--379,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,A Neural Signature of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.042,71,2011,
article,Ribeiro2004PB,"The discovery of experience-dependent brain reactivation during both slow-wave (SW) and rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep led to the notion that the consolidation of recently acquired memory traces requires neural replay during sleep. To date, however, several observations continue to undermine this hypothesis. To address some of these objections, we investigated the effects of a transient novel experience on the long-term evolution of ongoing neuronal activity in the rat forebrain. We observed that spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal ensemble activity originally produced by the tactile exploration of novel objects recurred for up to 48 h in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. This novelty-induced recurrence was characterized by low but significant correlations values. Nearly identical results were found for neuronal activity sampled when animals were moving between objects without touching them. In contrast, negligible recurrence was observed for neuronal patterns obtained when animals explored a familiar environment. While the reverberation of past patterns of neuronal activity was strongest during SW sleep, waking was correlated with a decrease of neuronal reverberation. REM sleep showed more variable results across animals. In contrast with data from hippocampal place cells, we found no evidence of time compression or expansion of neuronal reverberation in any of the sampled forebrain areas. Our results indicate that persistent experience-dependent neuronal reverberation is a general property of multiple forebrain structures. It does not consist of an exact replay of previous activity, but instead it defines a mild and consistent bias towards salient neural ensemble firing patterns. These results are compatible with a slow and progressive process of memory consolidation, reflecting novelty-related neuronal ensemble relationships that seem to be context- rather than stimulus-specific. Based on our current and previous results, we propose that the two major phases of sleep play distinct and complementary roles in memory consolidation: pretranscriptional recall during SW sleep and transcriptional storage during REM sleep.",,,,,,,,,"Ribeiro, Sidarta and Gervasoni, Damien and Soares, Ernesto S and Zhou, Yi and Lin, Shih-Chieh and Pantoja, Janaina and Lavine, Michael and Nicolelis, Miguel A L",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-15 10:33:46 +0100,2020-12-18 12:26:13 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pbio.0020024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLoS biology,,,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cerebral Cortex/metabolism; Electrophysiology; Hippocampus/metabolism; Male; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Neurons/metabolism; Prosencephalon/*metabolism; Putamen/metabolism; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; *Sleep; *Sleep, REM; Statistics as Topic; Thalamus/metabolism; Time Factors",,,,/Users/wittkuhn/Documents/bibliography/papers/ribeiro2004pb.bib,,,,Jan,,,1,,,E24--E24,,,,,,,,,,,,Long-lasting novelty-induced neuronal reverberation during slow-wave sleep in multiple forebrain areas,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14737198,2,2004,
article,Rich2016NN,"When making a subjective choice, the brain must compute a value for each option and compare those values to make a decision. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critically involved in this process, but the neural mechanisms remain obscure, in part due to limitations in our ability to measure and control the internal deliberations that can alter the dynamics of the decision process. Here we tracked these dynamics by recovering temporally precise neural states from multidimensional data in OFC. During individual choices, OFC alternated between states associated with the value of two available options, with dynamics that predicted whether a subject would decide quickly or vacillate between the two alternatives. Ensembles of value-encoding neurons contributed to these states, with individual neurons shifting activity patterns as the network evaluated each option. Thus, the mechanism of subjective decision-making involves the dynamic activation of OFC states associated with each choice alternative.",,,,,,,,,"Rich, Erin L and Wallis, Jonathan D",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-09 09:41:16 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/nn.4320,,,,,,,,,,,,1546-1726,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,7,,,973--980,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,highspeed,,Decoding subjective decisions from orbitofrontal cortex,,,,,,19,2016,

We investigated the large-scale structure of place field activity by recording hippocampal neurons in rats exploring a previously unencountered 48-meter-long track. Single-cell and population activities were well described by a two-parameter stochastic model. Individual neurons had their own characteristic propensity for forming fields randomly along the track, with some cells expressing many fields and many exhibiting few or none. Because of the particular distribution of propensities across cells, the number of neurons with fields scaled logarithmically with track length over a wide, ethological range. These features constrain hippocampal memory mechanisms, may allow efficient encoding of environments and experiences of vastly different extents and durations, and could reflect general principles of population coding.",,,,,,,,,"Rich, P.

article,Richards2014NN,"Memories are not static but continue to be processed after encoding. This is thought to allow the integration of related episodes via the identification of patterns. Although this idea lies at the heart of contemporary theories of systems consolidation, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Using a modified water-maze paradigm in which platforms are drawn stochastically from a spatial distribution, we found that mice were better at matching platform distributions 30 d compared to 1 d after training. Post-training time-dependent improvements in pattern matching were associated with increased sensitivity to new platforms that conflicted with the pattern. Increased sensitivity to pattern conflict was reduced by pharmacogenetic inhibition of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).

We propose learning higher-order graphs -- structured in a specific way that allows efficient learning, hierarchy formation, and inference -- as the general principle that connects these different desiderata. We show that these graphs can be learned efficiently from experienced sequences using a cloned Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), and uncertainty-aware planning can be achieved using message-passing inference. Using diverse experimental settings, we show that CHMMs can be used to explain the emergence of context-specific representations, formation of transferable structural knowledge, transitive inference, shortcut finding in novel spaces, remapping of place cells, and hierarchical planning.

Together, these discussions highlight critical emerging issues vital for identifying how reactivation affects circuits, and, in turn, behaviour, and provides a broader context for the contributions in this special issue.

article,Robinson2019N,"Rapid image presentations combined with time-resolved multivariate analysis methods of EEG or MEG (rapid-MVPA) offer unique potential in assessing the temporal limitations of the human visual system. Recent work has shown that multiple visual objects presented sequentially can be simultaneously decoded from M/EEG recordings. Interestingly, object representations reached higher stages of processing for slower image presentation rates compared to fast rates. This fast rate attenuation is probably caused by forward and backward masking from the other images in the stream. Two factors that are likely to influence masking during rapid streams are stimulus duration and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Here, we disentangle these effects by studying the emerging neural representation of visual objects using rapid-MVPA while independently manipulating stimulus duration and SOA. Our results show that longer SOAs enhance the decodability of neural representations, regardless of stimulus presentation duration, suggesting that subsequent images act as effective backward masks. In contrast, image duration does not appear to have a graded influence on object representations. Interestingly, however, decodability was improved when there was a gap between subsequent images, indicating that an abrupt onset or offset of an image enhances its representation. Our study yields insight into the dynamics of object processing in rapid streams, paving the way for future work using this promising approach.",,,,,,,,,"Robinson, Amanda K. and Grootswagers, Tijl and Carlson, Thomas A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-06 18:21:09 +0200,2020-07-06 18:21:32 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.04.050,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,224--231,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,The influence of image masking on object representations during rapid serial visual presentation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.04.050,197,2019,

article,Robinson2017N,"Recent studies have shown that hippocampal ``time cells'' code for sequential moments in temporally organized experiences. However, it is currently unknown whether these temporal firing patterns critically rely on upstream cortical input. Here we employ an optogenetic approach to explore the effect of large-scale inactivation of the medial entorhinal cortex on temporal, as well as spatial and object, coding by hippocampal CA1 neurons. Medial entorhinal inactivation produced a specific deficit in temporal coding in CA1 and resulted in significant impairment in memory across a temporal delay. In striking contrast, spatial and object coding remained intact. Further, we extended the scope of hippocampal phase precession to include object information relevant to memory and behavior. Overall, our work demonstrates that medial entorhinal activity plays an especially important role for CA1 in temporal coding and memory across time.",,,,,,,,,"Robinson, Nick T.

article,Robson1998N,"Averaged single trials (AST) allowed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to auditory stimuli to be measured at high temporal (1 s) and spatial (0.1 cm3) resolution. Using this paradigm we investigated the transient signal response to 100-ms tone bursts in trains of between 100 ms and 25.5 s in total duration. We have demonstrated that the fMRI response to such auditory stimuli is approximately linear for trains of 6 s and longer, but that shorter stimuli produce signals that are larger than might be expected from the response to the longer stimuli. This nonlinear behavior can be modeled if an adaptive response to each stimulus is assumed. A study using a novel paradigm was also performed in order to study the influence of scanner noise during fMRI experiments on the auditory system response to tones. This study demonstrated that the temporal response to 700-ms tone stimuli is modified when performed in the presence of scanner gradient noise, the modification being a small but significant increase (P < 0.05) in the magnitude of the response. Finally the ability to measure the onset of functional activation using the AST method was examined. It was found, with the aid of computer simulation that a sampling rate of one image per second is adequate to distinguish temporal responses. Using the data acquired in this study, onset times were calculated for the auditory cortex, and these results are consistent with current models of functional activation.",,,,,,,,,"Robson, Matthew D. and Dorosz, Jennifer L. and Gore, John C.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-07 13:55:36 +0200,2020-08-07 13:56:38 +0200,,,10.1006/nimg.1998.0322,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,"fMRI, auditory cortex, impulse response, linearity",,,,,,,,Apr,,,3,,,185--198,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Measurements of the Temporal {fMRI} Response of the Human Auditory Cortex to Trains of Tones,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/nimg.1998.0322,7,1998,
article,Roscow2019B,"Neural activity encoding recent experiences is replayed during sleep and rest to promote consolidation of the corresponding memories. However, precisely which features of experience influence replay prioritisation to optimise adaptive behaviour remains unclear. Here, we trained adult male rats on a novel maze-based rein-forcement learning task designed to dissociate reward outcomes from reward-prediction errors. Four variations of a reinforcement learning model were fitted to the rats{\textquoteright} behaviour over multiple days. Behaviour was best predicted by a model incorporating replay biased by reward-prediction error, compared to the same model with no replay; random replay or reward-biased replay produced poorer predictions of behaviour. This insight disentangles the influences of salience on replay, suggesting that reinforcement learning is tuned by post-learning replay biased by reward-prediction error, not by reward per se.

article,Rosenberg2021B,"Animals learn certain complex tasks remarkably fast, sometimes after a single experience. What behavioral algorithms support this efficiency? Many contemporary studies based on two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) tasks observe only slow or incomplete learning. As an alternative, we study the unconstrained behavior of mice in a complex labyrinth and measure the dynamics of learning and the behaviors that enable it. A mouse in the labyrinth makes ~2000 navigation decisions per hour. The animal quickly discovers the location of a reward in the maze and executes correct 10-bit choices after only 10 reward experiences {\textendash} a learning rate 1000-fold higher than in 2AFC experiments. Many mice improve discontinuously from one minute to the next, suggesting moments of sudden insight about the structure of the labyrinth.

article,Rossion2004P,"Theories of object recognition differ to the extent that they consider object representations as being mediated only by the shape of the object, or shape and surface details, if surface details are part of the representation. In particular, it has been suggested that color information may be helpful at recognizing objects only in very special cases, but not during basic-level object recognition in good viewing conditions. In this study, we collected normative data (naming agreement, familiarity, complexity, and imagery judgments) for Snodgrass and Vanderwart's object database of 260 black-and-white line drawings, and then compared the data to exactly the same shapes but with added gray-level texture and surface details (set 2), and color (set 3). Naming latencies were also recorded. Whereas the addition of texture and shading without color only slightly improved naming agreement scores for the objects, the addition of color information unambiguously improved naming accuracy and speeded correct response times. As shown in previous studies, the advantage provided by color was larger for objects with a diagnostic color, and structurally similar shapes, such as fruits and vegetables, but was also observed for man-made objects with and without a single diagnostic color. These observations show that basic-level `everyday' object recognition in normal conditions is facilitated by the presence of color information, and support a `shape + surface' model of object recognition, for which color is an integral part of the object representation. In addition, the new stimuli (sets 2 and 3) and the corresponding normative data provide valuable materials for a wide range of experimental and clinical studies of object recognition.",,,,,,,,,"Rossion, Bruno and Pourtois, Gilles",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 15:01:41 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1068/p5117,,,,,,,,,,,,1468-4233,,,Perception,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,2,,,217--236,,,,SAGE Publications,,,,,,koenigsberg,,Revisiting {Snodgrass} and {Vanderwart's} Object Pictorial Set: The Role of Surface Detail in Basic-Level Object Recognition,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5117,33,2004,

Changes in neocortical activity can precede SWR events, but whether and how these changes influence the content of replay remains unknown. Here we show that during sleep there is a rapid cortical--hippocampal--cortical loop of information flow around the times of SWRs. We recorded neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampus of rats as they learned a sound-guided task and during sleep. We found that patterned activation in AC precedes and predicts the subsequent content of hippocampal activity during SWRs, while hippocampal patterns during SWRs predict subsequent AC activity. Delivering sounds during sleep biased AC activity patterns, and sound-biased AC patterns predicted subsequent hippocampal activity.

article,Rowland2011PNAS,"In humans and other mammals, the hippocampus is critical for episodic memory, the autobiographical record of events, including where and when they happen. When one records from hippocampal pyramidal neurons in awake, behaving rodents, their most obvious firing correlate is the animal{\textquoteright}s position within a particular environment, earning them the name {\textquotedblleft}place cells.{\textquotedblright} When an animal explores a novel environment, its pyramidal neurons form their spatial receptive fields over a matter of minutes and are generally stable thereafter. This experience-dependent stabilization of place fields is therefore an attractive candidate neural correlate of the formation of hippocampal memory. However, precisely how the animal{\textquoteright}s experience of a context translates into stable place fields remains largely unclear. For instance, we still do not know whether observation of a space is sufficient to generate a stable hippocampal representation of that space because the animal must physically visit a spot to demonstrate which cells fire there. We circumvented this problem by comparing the relative stability of place fields of directly experienced space from merely observed space following blockade of NMDA receptors, which preferentially destabilizes newly generated place fields. This allowed us to determine whether place cells stably represent parts of the environment the animal sees, but does not actually occupy. We found that the formation of stable place fields clearly requires direct experience with a space. This suggests that place cells are part of an autobiographical record of events and their spatial context, consistent with providing the {\textquotedblleft}where{\textquotedblright} information in episodic memory.",,,,,,,,,"Rowland, David C. and Yanovich, Yelizaveta and Kentros, Clifford G.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-21 20:35:00 +0100,2020-12-21 20:35:16 +0100,,,10.1073/pnas.1105445108,,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/35/14654.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35,,,14654--14658,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,A stable hippocampal representation of a space requires its direct experience,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/35/14654,108,2011,

article,Rueckert2016SR,A recurrent spiking neural network is proposed that implements planning as probabilistic inference for finite and infinite horizon tasks. The architecture splits this problem into two parts: The stochastic transient firing of the network embodies the dynamics of the planning task. With appropriate injected input this dynamics is shaped to generate high-reward state trajectories. A general class of reward-modulated plasticity rules for these afferent synapses is presented. The updates optimize the likelihood of getting a reward through a variant of an Expectation Maximization algorithm and learning is guaranteed to convergence to a local maximum. We find that the network dynamics are qualitatively similar to transient firing patterns during planning and foraging in the hippocampus of awake behaving rats. The model extends classical attractor models and provides a testable prediction on identifying modulating contextual information. In a real robot arm reaching and obstacle avoidance task the ability to represent multiple task solutions is investigated. The neural planning method with its local update rules provides the basis for future neuromorphic hardware implementations with promising potentials like large data processing abilities and early initiation of strategies to avoid dangerous situations in robot co-worker scenarios.,,,,,,,,,"Rueckert, Elmar and Kappel, David and Tanneberg, Daniel and Pecevski, Dejan and Peters, Jan",,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,,,,,,,,,2016/02/18,,2021-01-08 17:33:11 +0100,2021-01-08 17:33:27 +0100,,,10.1038/srep21142,,,,,,,,,Rueckert2016,,2045-2322,,,,Scientific Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,21142,,,,,,,,,,,,Recurrent Spiking Networks Solve Planning Tasks,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21142,6,2016,

How is learned information stored to allow consistent behavior despite ongoing changes in neuronal activity? What functions could ongoing reconfiguration serve? We highlight recent experimental evidence for such representational drift in sensorimotor systems, and discuss how this fits into a framework of distributed population codes. We identify recent theoretical work that suggests computational roles for drift and argue that the recurrent and distributed nature of sensorimotor representations permits drift while limiting disruptive effects. We propose that representational drift may create error signals between interconnected brain regions that can be used to keep neural codes consistent in the presence of continual change.

The mechanisms by which neural circuits perform the computations prescribed by model-based RL remain largely unknown; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that neural circuits supporting model-based behavior are structurally homologous to and overlapping with those thought to carry out model-free temporal difference (TD) learning. Here, we lay out a family of approaches by which model-based computation may be built upon a core of TD learning. The foundation of this framework is the successor representation, a predictive state representation that, when combined with TD learning of value predictions, can produce a subset of the behaviors associated with model-based learning, while requiring less decision-time computation than dynamic programming. Using simulations, we delineate the precise behavioral capabilities enabled by evaluating actions using this approach, and compare them to those demonstrated by biological organisms. We then introduce two new algorithms that build upon the successor representation while progressively mitigating its limitations. Because this framework can account for the full range of observed putatively model-based behaviors while still utilizing a core TD framework, we suggest that it represents a neurally plausible family of mechanisms for model-based evaluation.",,,,,,,,,"Russek, Evan M. and Momennejad, Ida and Botvinick, Matthew M. and Gershman, Samuel J. and Daw, Nathaniel D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-24 15:39:07 +0100,2020-11-02 11:40:15 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005768,,,"Daunizeau, JeanEditor",,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,PLoS Computational Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Sep,,,9,,,e1005768,,,,Public Library of Science (PLoS),,,,,,replay; modeling,,Predictive representations can link model-based reinforcement learning to model-free mechanisms,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005768,13,2017,

article,Rusu2020H,"This article aims to provide a synthesis on the question how brain structures cooperate to accomplish hierarchically organized behaviors, characterized by low-level, habitual routines nested in larger sequences of planned, goal-directed behavior. The functioning of a connected set of brain structures---prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and dopaminergic mesencephalon---is reviewed in relation to two important distinctions: (a) goal-directed as opposed to habitual behavior and (b) model-based and model-free learning. Recent evidence indicates that the orbitomedial prefrontal cortices not only subserve goal-directed behavior and model-based learning, but also code the ``landscape'' (task space) of behaviorally relevant variables. While the hippocampus stands out for its role in coding and memorizing world state representations, it is argued to function in model-based learning but is not required for coding of action--outcome contingencies, illustrating that goal-directed behavior is not congruent with model-based learning. While the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum largely conform to the dichotomy between habitual versus goal-directed behavior, ventral striatal functions go beyond this distinction. Next, we contextualize findings on coding of reward-prediction errors by ventral tegmental dopamine neurons to suggest a broader role of mesencephalic dopamine cells, viz. in behavioral reactivity and signaling unexpected sensory changes. We hypothesize that goal-directed behavior is hierarchically organized in interconnected cortico-basal ganglia loops, where a limbic-affective prefrontal-ventral striatal loop controls action selection in a dorsomedial prefrontal--striatal loop, which in turn regulates activity in sensorimotor-dorsolateral striatal circuits. This structure for behavioral organization requires alignment with mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. We propose that frontal corticothalamic circuits form a high-level loop for memory processing that initiates and temporally organizes nested activities in lower-level loops, including the hippocampus and the ripple-associated replay it generates. The evidence on hierarchically organized behavior converges with that on consolidation mechanisms in suggesting a frontal-to-caudal directionality in processing control.",,,,,,,,,"Rusu, Silviu I. and Pennartz, Cyriel M.

article,Saad2001HBM,"In this study, we implemented a new method for measuring the temporal delay of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses and then estimated the statistical distribution of response delays evoked by visual stimuli (checkered annuli) within and across voxels in human visual cortex. We assessed delay variability among different cortical sites and between parenchyma and blood vessels. Overall, 81% of all responsive voxels showed activation in phase with the stimulus while the remaining voxels showed antiphase, suppressive responses. Mean delays for activated and suppressed voxels were not significantly different (P < 0.001). Cortical flat maps showed that the pattern of activated and suppressed voxels was dynamically induced and depended on stimulus size. Mean delays for blood vessels were 0.7--2.4 sec longer than for parenchyma (P < 0.01). However, both parenchyma and blood vessels produced responses with long delays. We developed a model to identify and quantify different components contributing to variability in the empirical delay measurements. Within‐voxel changes in delay over time were fully accounted for by the effects of empirically measured fMRI noise with virtually no measurable variability associated with the stimulus‐induced response itself. Across voxels, as much as 47% of the delay variance was also the result of fMRI noise, with the remaining variance reflecting fixed differences in response delay among brain sites. In all cases, the contribution of fMRI noise to the delay variance depended on the noise power at the stimulus frequency.

article,Sadeh2019H,"It is well‐established that whether the information will be remembered or not depends on the extent to which the learning context is reinstated during post‐encoding rest and/or at retrieval. It has yet to be determined, however, if the fundamental importance of contextual reinstatement to memory extends to periods of spontaneous neurocognitive activity prior to learning. We thus asked whether memory performance can be predicted by the extent to which spontaneous pre‐encoding neural patterns resemble patterns elicited during encoding. Individuals studied and retrieved lists of words while undergoing fMRI‐scanning.

Language acquisition involves both types of mechanisms, but most theorists emphasize the relative importance of experience-independent mechanisms. The present study shows that a fundamental task of language acquisition, segmentation of words from fluent speech, can be accomplished by 8-month-old infants based solely on the statistical relationships between neighboring speech sounds.

article,Sakurai1996JN,"The objective of this study was to determine whether each of several different memory processes is encoded exclusively by specific single neurons (single-neuron coding) or by overlapped groups of neurons (population coding by cell assembly). Single neuronal activity was recorded from the rat hippocampal formation (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) and temporal cortex during the performance of simple auditory, simple visual, and configural auditory-visual discrimination tasks. All the tasks employed the identical apparatus and time parameters and differed only in the type of stimuli to be processed for correct performance. Single neurons showing significantly differential activity among the discriminative stimuli in each task were judged to be task-related and involved in the memory process of the task. Of the total number of neurons recorded from the hippocampal formation and temporal cortex, 21{\textendash} 26\% of the neurons showed task-related activity in only one task, in two tasks, or in all three tasks. This result indicates some overlapping among the neurons involved in each of teh different memory processes. A cross-correlation analysis tested activity correlations among the neurons recorded simultaneously. Most pairs of the hippocampal neurons related to the same tasks (same memory processes) showed correlations during performance of the related tasks. This result showing coactivation of the same types of task-related neurons, together with the result showing the overlapping of task-related neurons, supports the concept of population coding by cell assemblies specifically in the hippocampal formation during memory processing.",,,,,,,,,"Sakurai, Y",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-14 17:43:25 +0100,2021-01-14 17:43:41 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-08-02809.1996,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/16/8/2809.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,2809--2819,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Hippocampal and neocortical cell assemblies encode memory processes for different types of stimuli in the rat,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/16/8/2809,16,1996,

article,Samsonovich2005LM,"The goal of this work is to extend the theoretical understanding of the relationship between hippocampal spatial and memory functions to the level of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and episodic memory retrieval. The proposed unifying theory describes both phenomena within a unique framework, as based on one and the same pathfinding function of the hippocampus. We propose a mechanism of reconstruction of the context of experience involving a search for a nearly shortest path in the space of remembered contexts. To analyze this concept in detail, we define a simple connectionist model consistent with available rodent and human neurophysiological data. Numerical study of the model begins with the spatial domain as a simple analogy for more complex phenomena. It is demonstrated how a nearly shortest path is quickly found in a familiar environment. We prove numerically that associative learning during sharp waves can account for the necessary properties of hippocampal place cells. Computational study of the model is extended to other cognitive paradigms, with the main focus on episodic memory retrieval. We show that the ability to find a correct path may be vital for successful retrieval. The model robustly exhibits the pathfinding capacity within a wide range of several factors, including its memory load (up to 30,000 abstract contexts), the number of episodes that become associated with potential target contexts, and the level of dynamical noise. We offer several testable critical predictions in both spatial and memory domains to validate the theory. Our results suggest that (1) the pathfinding function of the hippocampus, in addition to its associative and memory indexing functions, may be vital for retrieval of certain episodic memories, and (2) the hippocampal spatial navigation function could be a precursor of its memory function.",,,,,,,,,"Samsonovich, Alexei V and Ascoli, Giorgio A",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-27 12:27:38 +0100,2020-11-27 12:29:01 +0100,,,10.1101/lm.85205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Learning \& Memory,,,,,,,,,,,Mar-Apr,,,2,,,193--208,,,,,,,,,,,,A simple neural network model of the hippocampus suggesting its pathfinding role in episodic memory retrieval.,,,,,,12,2005,
article,Samsonovich1997JN,"A minimal synaptic architecture is proposed for how the brain might perform path integration by computing the next internal representation of self-location from the current representation and from the perceived velocity of motion. In the model, a place-cell assembly called a {\textquotedblleft}chart{\textquotedblright} contains a two-dimensional attractor set called an {\textquotedblleft}attractor map{\textquotedblright} that can be used to represent coordinates in any arbitrary environment, once associative binding has occurred between chart locations and sensory inputs. In hippocampus, there are different spatial relations among place fields in different environments and behavioral contexts. Thus, the same units may participate in many charts, and it is shown that the number of uncorrelated charts that can be encoded in the same recurrent network is potentially quite large. According to this theory, the firing of a given place cell is primarily a cooperative effect of the activity of its neighbors on the currently active chart. Therefore, it is not particularly useful to think of place cells as encoding any particular external object or event. Because of its recurrent connections, hippocampal field CA3 is proposed as a possible location for this {\textquotedblleft}multichart{\textquotedblright} architecture; however, other implementations in anatomy would not invalidate the main concepts. The model is implemented numerically both as a network of integrate-and-fire units and as a {\textquotedblleft}macroscopic{\textquotedblright} (with respect to the space of states) description of the system, based on a continuous approximation defined by a system of stochastic differential equations. It provides an explanation for a number of hitherto perplexing observations on hippocampal place fields, including doubling, vanishing, reshaping in distorted environments, acquiring directionality in a two-goal shuttling task, rapid formation in a novel environment, and slow rotation after disorientation. The model makes several new predictions about the expected properties of hippocampal place cells and other cells of the proposed network.",,,,,,,,,"Samsonovich, Alexei and McNaughton, Bruce L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-02 13:10:39 +0100,2020-11-02 13:11:01 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-15-05900.1997,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/15/5900.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,5900--5920,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Path Integration and Cognitive Mapping in a Continuous Attractor Neural Network Model,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/15/5900,17,1997,
article,Sanders2020E,"Cells in the hippocampus tuned to spatial location (place cells) typically change their tuning when an animal changes context, a phenomenon known as remapping. A fundamental challenge to understanding remapping is the fact that what counts as a ``context change'' has never been precisely defined. Furthermore, different remapping phenomena have been classified on the basis of how much the tuning changes after different types and degrees of context change, but the relationship between these variables is not clear. We address these ambiguities by formalizing remapping in terms of hidden state inference. According to this view, remapping does not directly reflect objective, observable properties of the environment, but rather subjective beliefs about the hidden state of the environment. We show how the hidden state framework can resolve a number of puzzles about the nature of remapping.",,,,,,,,,"Sanders, Honi and Wilson, Matthew A and Gershman, Samuel J",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-10 14:20:36 +0200,2020-06-10 14:21:01 +0200,,,10.7554/elife.51140,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,Jun,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,Hippocampal remapping as hidden state inference,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.51140,9,2020,

article,Savage2019N,"For the past two decades, Cormac McCarthy --- whose ten novels include The Road, No Country for Old Men and Blood Meridian --- has provided extensive editing to numerous faculty members and postdocs at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) in New Mexico. He has helped to edit works by scientists such as Harvard University's first tenured female theoretical physicist, Lisa Randall, and physicist Geoffrey West, who authored the popular-science book Scale. Van Savage, a theoretical biologist and ecologist, first met McCarthy in 2000, and they overlapped at the SFI for about four years while Savage was a graduate student and then a postdoc. Savage has received invaluable editing advice from McCarthy on several science papers published over the past 20 years. While on sabbatical at the SFI during the winter of 2018, Savage had lively weekly lunches with McCarthy. They worked to condense McCarthy's advice to its most essential points so that it could be shared with everyone.

article,Sawangjit2018N,"There is a long-standing division in memory research between hippocampus-dependent memory and non-hippocampus-dependent memory, as only the latter can be acquired and retrieved in the absence of normal hippocampal function1,2. Consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory, in particular, is strongly supported by sleep3,4,5. Here we show that the formation of long-term representations in a rat model of non-hippocampus-dependent memory depends not only on sleep but also on activation of a hippocampus-dependent mechanism during sleep. Rats encoded non-hippocampus-dependent (novel-object recognition6,7,8) and hippocampus-dependent (object--place recognition) memories before a two-hour period of sleep or wakefulness. Memory was tested either immediately thereafter or remotely (after one or three weeks). Whereas object--place recognition memory was stronger for rats that had slept after encoding (rather than being awake) at both immediate and remote testing, novel-object recognition memory profited from sleep only three weeks after encoding, at which point it was preserved in rats that had slept after encoding but not in those that had been awake. Notably, inactivation of the hippocampus during post-encoding sleep by intrahippocampal injection of muscimol abolished the sleep-induced enhancement of remote novel-object recognition memory. By contrast, muscimol injection before remote retrieval or memory encoding had no effect on test performance, confirming that the encoding and retrieval of novel-object recognition memory are hippocampus-independent. Remote novel-object recognition memory was associated with spindle activity during post-encoding slow-wave sleep, consistent with the view that neuronal memory replay during slow-wave sleep contributes to long-term memory formation. Our results indicate that the hippocampus has an important role in long-term consolidation during sleep even for memories that have previously been considered hippocampus-independent.",,,,,,,,,"Sawangjit, Anuck and Oyanedel, Carlos N. and Niethard, Niels and Salazar, Carolina and Born, Jan and Inostroza, Marion",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 18:39:15 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/s41586-018-0716-8,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-4687,,,Nature,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,7734,,,109--113,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,The hippocampus is crucial for forming non-hippocampal long-term memory during sleep,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0716-8,564,2018,

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning.

article,Schad2020JML,"Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be ``tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary `omnibus' F test'' (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-tests.

These studies have employed fMRI, leaving open the possibility that the MTL is involved but not necessary for SL. Here, we examined this issue in a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and broader MTL damage. In Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ and matched control participants were passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities in the co-occurrence of items. In a subsequent test phase, the control groups exhibited reliable SL in all conditions, successfully discriminating regularities from recombinations of the same items into novel foil sequences. LSJ, however, exhibited no SL, failing to discriminate regularities from foils. Experiment 3 ruled out more general explanations for this failure, such as inattention during exposure or difficulty following test instructions, by showing that LSJ could discriminate which individual items had been exposed.

article,Schapiro2012CB,"Regularities are gradually represented in cortex after extensive experience [1], and yet they can influence behavior after minimal exposure [2, 3]. What kind of representations support such rapid statistical learning? The medial temporal lobe (MTL) can represent information from even a single experience [4], making it a good candidate system for assisting in initial learning about regularities. We combined anatomical segmentation of the MTL, high-resolution fMRI, and multivariate pattern analysis to identify representations of objects in cortical and hippocampal areas of human MTL, assessing how these representations were shaped by exposure to regularities. Subjects viewed a continuous visual stream containing hidden temporal relationships - pairs of objects that reliably appeared nearby in time. We compared the pattern of blood oxygen level-dependent activity evoked by each object before and after this exposure, and found that perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, subiculum, CA1, and CA2/CA3/dentate gyrus (CA2/3/DG) encoded regularities by increasing the representational similarity of their constituent objects.

subsequent memory. A critical open question is how memories are prioritized for this replay.
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern analysis to track item-level
replay in the hippocampus during an awake rest period after participants studied 15 objects
and completed a memory test. Objects that were remembered less well were replayed more
during the subsequent rest period, suggesting a prioritization process in which weaker
memories---memories most vulnerable to forgetting---are selected for replay. In a second
session 12 hours later, more replay of an object during a rest period predicted better subsequent
memory for that object. Replay predicted memory improvement across sessions only
for participants who slept during that interval. Our results provide evidence that replay in the
human hippocampus prioritizes weakly learned information, predicts subsequent memory

Although this fits with the known role of the hippocampus in rapid learning, it seems at odds with the idea that the hippocampus specializes in memorizing individual episodes. In particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory argues that there is a computational trade-off between learning the specifics of individual experiences and regularities that hold across those experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a neural network model that instantiates known properties of hippocampal projections and subfields to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We found that the monosynaptic pathway---the pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to region CA1---was able to support statistical learning, while the trisynaptic pathway---connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate gyrus and CA3---learned individual episodes, with apparent representations of regularities resulting from associative reactivation through recurrence.

article,Schielzeth2020MEE,"Linear mixed‐effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed‐effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher‐level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower‐level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed‐effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed‐effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.",,,,,,,,,"Schielzeth, Holger and Dingemanse, Niels J. and Nakagawa, Shinichi and Westneat, David F. and Allegue, Hassen and Teplitsky, C{\'e}line and R{\'e}ale, Denis and Dochtermann, Ned A. and Garamszegi, L{\'a}szl{\'o} Zsolt and Araya‐Ajoy, Yimen G.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 09:45:40 +0200,2020-07-20 09:46:47 +0200,,,10.1111/2041-210x.13434,,,"Sutherland, ChrisEditor",,,,,,,,,2041-210X,,,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,,,,,Wiley,,,,,,,,Robustness of linear mixed‐effects models to violations of distributional assumptions,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13434,,2020,

article,Schlichting2016NLM,"Learning occurs in the context of existing memories. Encountering new information that relates to prior knowledge may trigger integration, whereby established memories are updated to incorporate new content. Here, we provide a critical test of recent theories suggesting hippocampal (HPC) and medial prefrontal (MPFC) involvement in integration, both during and immediately following encoding. Human participants with established memories for a set of initial (AB) associations underwent fMRI scanning during passive rest and encoding of new related (BC) and unrelated (XY) pairs. We show that HPC--MPFC functional coupling during learning was more predictive of trial-by-trial memory for associations related to prior knowledge relative to unrelated associations. Moreover, the degree to which HPC--MPFC functional coupling was enhanced following overlapping encoding was related to memory integration behavior across participants. We observed a dissociation between anterior and posterior MPFC, with integration signatures during post-encoding rest specifically in the posterior subregion. These results highlight the persistence of integration signatures into post-encoding periods, indicating continued processing of interrelated memories during rest. We also interrogated the coherence of white matter tracts to assess the hypothesis that integration behavior would be related to the integrity of the underlying anatomical pathways. Consistent with our predictions, more coherent HPC--MPFC white matter structure was associated with better performance across participants. This HPC--MPFC circuit also interacted with content-sensitive visual cortex during learning and rest, consistent with reinstatement of prior knowledge to enable updating.

Using the Restaurant Row foraging task, we found that mPFC disruption resulted in decreased vicarious trial and error behavior, reduced the number of theta sequences, and impaired theta sequences in hippocampus. mPFC disruption led to larger changes in the initiation of the hippocampal theta sequences that represent the current location of the rat rather than to the later portions that represent the future outcomes. These data suggest that the mPFC likely provides an important component to the initiation of deliberative sequences and provides support for an episodic-future thinking, working memory interpretation of deliberation.",,,,,,,,,"Schmidt, Brandy and Duin, Anneke A. and Redish, A.

The MuZero algorithm learns an iterable model that produces predictions relevant to planning: the action-selection policy, the value function and the reward. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games3---the canonical video game environment for testing artificial intelligence techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled4---the MuZero algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance.

To test this idea, we apply pattern-classification techniques to neuroimaging data from humans performing a decision-making task with 16 states. We show that unobservable task states can be decoded from activity in OFC, and decoding accuracy is related to task performance and the occurrence of individual behavioral errors. Moreover, similarity between the neural representations of consecutive states correlates with behavioral accuracy in corresponding state transitions.

Yet, ignoring everything else might hinder the ability to discover new ways to achieve the same goal.

Multivariate neuroimaging analyses showed that before the spontaneous change to an alternative strategy, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) encoded information that was irrelevant for the current strategy but necessary for the later strategy. Importantly, this neural effect was related to future behavioral changes: information encoding in MPFC was changed only in participants who eventually switched their strategy and started before the actual strategy change.

article,Schulreich2020CC,"Adaptive performance in uncertain environments depends on the ability to continuously update internal beliefs about environmental states. Recent correlative evidence suggests that a frontoparietal network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) supports belief updating under uncertainty, but whether the dlPFC serves a ``causal'' role in this process is currently not clear. To elucidate its contribution, we leveraged transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right dlPFC, while 91 participants performed an incentivized belief-updating task. Participants also underwent a psychosocial stress or control manipulation to investigate the role of stress, which is known to modulate dlPFC functioning. We observed enhanced monetary value updating after anodal tDCS when it was normatively expected from a Bayesian perspective. A model-based analysis indicates that this effect was driven by belief updating. However, we also observed enhanced non-normative value updating, which might have been driven instead by expectancy violation. Enhanced normative and non-normative value updating reflected increased vs. decreased Bayesian rationality, respectively. Furthermore, cortisol increases were associated with enhanced positive, but not with negative, value updating.

article,Schultz1998JN,"The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic activations after primary liquid and food rewards and conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding events that are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying the retrograde action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation between the different reward signals may assure the use of specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a defective reward signal but may reflect the absence of a general enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic transmission of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic neurons.

article,Schultz2000ARN,"Associative learning enables animals to anticipate the occurrence of important outcomes. Learning occurs when the actual outcome differs from the predicted outcome, resulting in a prediction error. Neurons in several brain structures appear to code prediction errors in relation to rewards, punishments, external stimuli, and behavioral reactions. In one form, dopamine neurons, norepinephrine neurons, and nucleus basalis neurons broadcast prediction errors as global reinforcement or teaching signals to large postsynaptic structures. In other cases, error signals are coded by selected neurons in the cerebellum, superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, parietal cortex, striatum, and visual system, where they influence specific subgroups of neurons. Prediction errors can be used in postsynaptic structures for the immediate selection of behavior or for synaptic changes underlying behavioral learning. The coding of prediction errors may represent a basic mode of brain function that may also contribute to the processing of sensory information and the short-term control of behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Schultz, Wolfram and Dickinson, Anthony",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-14 17:07:24 +0200,2020-04-14 17:07:49 +0200,,,10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.473,,,,,,,,,,,,1545-4126,,,Annual Review of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,1,,,473--500,,,,Annual Reviews,,,,,,,,Neuronal Coding of Prediction Errors,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.473,23,2000,

Here we use multivariate pattern classification to decode electrical brain activity during sleep and determine what type of images participants had viewed in a preceding learning session. We find significant patterns of learning-related processing during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, which are generalizable across subjects. This processing occurs in a cyclic fashion during time windows congruous to critical periods of synaptic plasticity. Its spatial distribution over the scalp and relevant frequencies differ between NREM and REM sleep. Moreover, only the strength of reprocessing in slow-wave sleep influenced later memory performance, speaking for at least two distinct underlying mechanisms between these states. We thus show that memory reprocessing occurs in both NREM and REM sleep in humans and that it pertains to different aspects of the consolidation process.",,,,,,,,,"Sch{\""o}nauer, M. and Alizadeh, S. and Jamalabadi, H. and Abraham, A. and Pawlizki, A. and Gais, S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-06 15:30:46 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/ncomms15404,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,Nature Communications,,,,,,,,,,,May,,,1,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Decoding material-specific memory reprocessing during sleep in humans,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15404,8,2017,

article,Senoussi2020B,"Being able to predict future events in learned sequences is a fundamental cognitive ability. Successful behavior requires the brain to not only anticipate an upcoming event, but to also continue to keep track of the sequence in case of eventual disruptions, (e.g., when a predicted event does not occur). However, the precise neural mechanisms supporting such processes remain unknown. Here, using multivariate pattern classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) activity and time-frequency amplitude, we show that the visual system represents upcoming expected stimuli during a sequence-learning task. Stimulus-evoked neural representations were reinstated prior to expected stimulus onset, and when an anticipated stimulus was unexpectedly withheld, suggesting proactive reinstatement of sensory templates. Importantly, stimulus representation of the absent stimulus co-occurred with an emerging representation of the following stimulus in the sequence, showing that the brain actively maintained sequence order even when the sequence was perturbed. Finally, selective activity was evident in the alpha-beta band (9-20 Hz) amplitude topographies, confirming the role of alpha-beta oscillations in carrying information about the nature of sensory expectations. These results show that the brain dynamically implements anticipatory mechanisms that reinstate sensory representations, and that allow us to make predictions about events further in the future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Senoussi, Mehdi and VanRullen, Rufin and Reddy, Leila",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-02 13:49:31 +0100,2020-12-02 13:49:47 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.11.28.402123,,,,,2020.11.28.402123,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/30/2020.11.28.402123.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Anticipatory reinstatement of expected perceptual events during visual sequence learning,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/30/2020.11.28.402123,,2020,
article,Serences2009PS,"Working memory (WM) involves maintaining information in an on-line state. One emerging view is that information in WM is maintained via sensory recruitment, such that information is stored via sustained activity in the sensory areas that encode the to-be-remembered information. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed that key sensory regions such as primary visual cortex (V1) showed little evidence of sustained increases in mean activation during a WM delay period, though such amplitude increases have typically been used to determine whether a region is involved in on-line maintenance. However, a multivoxel pattern analysis of delay-period activity revealed a sustained pattern of activation in V1 that represented only the intentionally stored feature of a multifeature object. Moreover, the pattern of delay activity was qualitatively similar to that observed during the discrimination of sensory stimuli, suggesting that WM representations in V1 are reasonable ``copies'' of those evoked during pure sensory processing.",,,,,,,,,"Serences, John T. and Ester, Edward F. and Vogel, Edward K. and Awh, Edward",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-06 18:40:01 +0200,2020-07-06 18:40:39 +0200,,,10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02276.x,,,,,,,,,,,,1467-9280,,,Psychological Science,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,2,,,207--214,,,,SAGE Publications,,,,,,,,Stimulus-Specific Delay Activity in Human Primary Visual Cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02276.x,20,2009,

article,Shadlen2016N,"Decisions take time, and as a rule more difficult decisions take more time. But this only raises the question of what consumes the time. For decisions informed by a sequence of samples of evidence, the answer is straightforward: more samples are available with more time. Indeed, the speed and accuracy of such decisions are explained by the accumulation of evidence to a threshold or bound. However, the same framework seems to apply to decisions that are not obviously informed by sequences of evidence samples. Here, we proffer the hypothesis that the sequential character of such tasks involves retrieval of evidence from memory. We explore this hypothesis by focusing on value-based decisions and argue that mnemonic processes can account for regularities in choice and decision time. We speculate on the neural mechanisms that link sampling of evidence from memory to circuits that represent the accumulated evidence bearing on a choice. We propose that memory processes may contribute to a wider class of decisions that conform to the regularities of choice-reaction time predicted by the sequential sampling framework.",,,,,,,,,"Shadlen, Michael N. and Shohamy, Daphna",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 16:58:40 +0100,2021-01-18 16:59:07 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.04.036,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,927 - 939,,,,,,,,,,,,Decision Making and Sequential Sampling from Memory,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627316301234,90,2016,
article,Shahar2019PNAS,"It is widely accepted that agents learn action values based on experience in a {\textquotedblleft}model-free{\textquotedblright} manner (i.e., without holding a model of the environment). Environments usually embody many features, where a subset is considered relevant for model-free outcome learning. In this study, we show that a putative model-free system assigns credit to outcome-irrelevant task representations, regardless of stimulus features. The degree of impact of these associations is strongly linked to deployment of model-based strategies. Our findings motivate a reconsideration of how model-free representations are formed and regulated according to the structure of the environment.Model-free learning enables an agent to make better decisions based on prior experience while representing only minimal knowledge about an environment{\textquoteright}s structure. It is generally assumed that model-free state representations are based on outcome-relevant features of the environment. Here, we challenge this assumption by providing evidence that a putative model-free system assigns credit to task representations that are irrelevant to an outcome. We examined data from 769 individuals performing a well-described 2-step reward decision task where stimulus identity but not spatial-motor aspects of the task predicted reward. We show that participants assigned value to spatial-motor representations despite it being outcome irrelevant. Strikingly, spatial-motor value associations affected behavior across all outcome-relevant features and stages of the task, consistent with credit assignment to low-level state-independent task representations. Individual difference analyses suggested that the impact of spatial-motor value formation was attenuated for individuals who showed greater deployment of goal-directed (model-based) strategies. Our findings highlight a need for a reconsideration of how model-free representations are formed and regulated according to the structure of the environment.",,,,,,,,,"Shahar, Nitzan and Moran, Rani and Hauser, Tobias U. and Kievit, Rogier A. and McNamee, Daniel and Moutoussis, Michael and and Dolan, Raymond J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-15 11:09:47 +0200,2020-07-15 11:10:16 +0200,,,10.1073/pnas.1821647116,,,"Bullmore, Edward and Dolan, Raymond and Goodyer, Ian and Fonagy, Peter and Jones, Peter and Moutoussis, Michael and Hauser, Tobias and Neufeld, Sharon and Romero-Garcia, Rafael and St Clair, Michelle and V{\'e}rtes, Petra and Whitaker, Kirstie and Inkster, Becky and Prabhu, Gita and Ooi, Cinly and Toseeb, Umar and Widmer, Barry and Bhatti, Junaid and Villis, Laura and Alrumaithi, Ayesha and Birt, Sarah and Bowler, Aislinn and Cleridou, Kalia and Dadabhoy, Hina and Davies, Emma and Firkins, Ashlyn and Granville, Sian and Harding, Elizabeth and Hopkins, Alexandra and Isaacs, Daniel and King, Janchai and Kokorikou, Danae and Maurice, Christina and McIntosh, Cleo and Memarzia, Jessica and Mills, Harriet and O{\textquoteright}Donnell, Ciara and Pantaleone, Sara and Scott, Jenny and Fearon, Pasco and Suckling, John and van Harmelen, Anne-Laura and Kievit, Rogier",,,https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15871.full.pdf,,,,,,0027-8424,,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32,,,15871--15876,,,,National Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,Credit assignment to state-independent task representations and its relationship with model-based decision making,,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15871,116,2019,
article,Shahbaba2019B,"The hippocampus is critical to the temporal organization of our experiences, including the ability to remember past event sequences and predict future ones. Although this fundamental capacity is conserved across modalities and species, its underlying neuronal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we recorded hippocampal ensemble activity as rats remembered a sequence of nonspatial events (5 odor presentations unfolding over several seconds), using a task with established parallels in humans. Using novel statistical methods and deep learning techniques, we then identified new forms of sequential organization in hippocampal activity linked with task performance. We discovered that sequential firing fields ({\textquotedblleft}time cells{\textquotedblright}) provided temporal information within and across events in the sequence, and that distinct types of task-critical information (stimulus identity, temporal order, and trial outcome) were also sequentially differentiated within event presentations. Finally, as previously only observed with spatial information, we report that the representations of past, present and future events were sequentially activated within individual event presentations, and that these sequential representations could be compressed within an individual theta cycle. These findings strongly suggest that a fundamental function of the hippocampal network is to encode and preserve the sequential order of experiences, and use these representations to generate predictions to inform decision-making.",,,,,,,,,"Shahbaba, Babak and Li, Lingge and Agostinelli, Forest and Saraf, Mansi and Elias, Gabriel A. and Baldi, Pierre and Fortin, Norbert J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-20 12:22:30 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/840199,,,,,840199,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/13/840199.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Hippocampal ensembles represent sequential relationships among discrete nonspatial events,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/13/840199,,2019,

Understanding how it regulates its oxygen supply is therefore key for designing interventions to preserve its function. However, studies of neurovascular function in the hippocampus in vivo have been limited by its relative inaccessibility. Here we compared hippocampal and visual cortical neurovascular function in awake mice, using two photon imaging of individual neurons and vessels and measures of regional blood flow and haemoglobin oxygenation. We show that blood flow, blood oxygenation and neurovascular coupling were decreased in the hippocampus compared to neocortex, because of differences in both the vascular network and pericyte and endothelial cell function. Modelling oxygen diffusion indicates that these features of the hippocampal vasculature could explain its sensitivity to damage during neurological conditions, including Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease, where the brain{\textquoteright}s energy supply is decreased.",,,,,,,,,"Shaw, K. and Bell, L. and Boyd, K. and Grijseels, D.M. and Clarke, D. and Bonnar, O. and Crombag, H.S. and Hall, C.N.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-13 09:53:02 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/835728,,,,,835728,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/08/835728.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,"Hippocampus has lower oxygenation and weaker control of brain blood flow than cortex, due to microvascular differences",,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/08/835728,,2019,

Here, we show that mouse hippocampal neurons can globally remap, forming multiple distinct representations (maps) of the same familiar environment, without any apparent changes in sensory input or behavior. Alternations between maps occurred only across separate visits to the environment, implying switching between distinct stable attractors in the hippocampal network. Importantly, the different maps were spatially informative and persistent over weeks, demonstrating that they can be reliably stored and retrieved from long-term memory.

We present a normative model of EVC that integrates three critical factors: the expected payoff from a controlled process, the amount of control that must be invested to achieve that payoff, and the cost in terms of cognitive effort.

We discovered that, when faced with this conflict, the brain prioritizes prediction over encoding. Behavioral tasks showed that pictures allowing for prediction of what will appear next based on learned regularities are poorly encoded into memory. Brain imaging revealed that predictive representations in the hippocampus may be responsible for this worse episodic encoding and suggested that such interference may result from competition between hippocampal pathways.

incollection,Shin2017ANIPS,"Attempts to train a comprehensive artificial intelligence capable of solving multiple tasks have been impeded by a chronic problem called catastrophic forgetting. Although simply replaying all previous data alleviates the problem, it requires large memory and even worse, often infeasible in real world applications where the access to past data is limited.

Recent evidence indicates that different network activity patterns, each marked by local field potential signatures, play distinct roles in mediating long-range interactions between these regions to support memory processing. We propose that network patterns underlie multiple communication modes between these regions, and support different cognitive demands during ongoing behavior. Network patterns may represent a fundamental neurophysiological mechanism through which the hippocampus communicates memory-related information with other regions.

However, how replay supports both goal-directed learning and memory-guided decision making is unclear. We therefore continuously tracked awake replay in the same hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles throughout learning of a spatial alternation task. We found that, during pauses between behavioral trajectories, reverse and forward hippocampal replay supports an internal cognitive search of available past and future possibilities and exhibits opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay distinguished correct past and future paths from alternative choices, suggesting a role in recall of past paths to guide planning of future decisions for spatial working memory.

article,Shin2020P,"How do we evaluate a group of people after having positive experiences with some members and negative experiences with others? In particular, how do rare experiences with members who stand out (e.g., negative experiences when most are positive) influence the overall impression we have of the group? Here, we show that such rare events may be overweighted due to normative inference of the hidden, or latent, causes that are believed to generate the observed events. We propose a Bayesian latent-cause inference model that learns environmental statistics by combining highly similar events together and separating rare or highly variable observations. The model predicts that group evaluations that rely on averaging inferred latent causes will overweight variable events. We empirically tested these model-derived predictions in four decision-making experiments, where subjects observed a sequence of social (Exp 1 to 3) or non-social (Exp 4) behaviors and were subsequently asked to estimate the average of observed values. As predicted by our latent-cause model, average estimation was biased toward rare and highly variable events when observing social behaviors. We then showed that tracking of a single summary value, instead of parsing events into distinct latent causes, eliminates the bias. These results suggest that biases in evaluations of social groups, such as negativity bias, may arise from the causal inference process of the group.",,,,,,,,,"Shin, Yeon Soon and Niv, Yael",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-10 15:53:23 +0200,2020-06-10 15:54:53 +0200,,,10.31234/osf.io/tkhwn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,Center for Open Science,,,,,,,,Biased evaluations emerge from inferring hidden causes,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tkhwn,,2020,

article,Shohamy2013JEPG,"The quintessential memory system in the human brain---the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe---is often treated as a module for the formation of conscious, or declarative, memories. However, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus plays a broader role in memory and cognition and that theories organizing memory into strictly dedicated systems may need to be updated. We first consider the historical evidence for the specialized role of the hippocampus in declarative memory. Then, we describe the serendipitous encounter that motivated the special section in this issue, based on parallel research from our labs that suggested a more pervasive contribution of the hippocampus to cognition beyond declarative memory. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework that describes 2 general mechanisms for how the hippocampus interacts with other brain systems and cognitive processes: the memory modulation hypothesis, in which mnemonic representations in the hippocampus modulate the operation of other systems, and the adaptive function hypothesis, in which specialized computations in the hippocampus are recruited as a component of both mnemonic and nonmnemonic functions.

Prior data suggest that generalization may stem from inference-based processes at the time of generalization. By contrast, generalization may emerge from mnemonic processes occurring while premise events are encoded. Here, participants engaged in a two-phase learning and generalization task, wherein they learned a series of overlapping associations and subsequently generalized what they learned to novel stimulus combinations. Functional MRI revealed that successful generalization was associated with coupled changes in learning-phase activity in the hippocampus and midbrain (ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra).

article,Shpokayte2020B,"The hippocampus is involved in processing a variety of mnemonic computations including the spatiotemporal components, as well as the corresponding emotional dimensions, of contextual memory. Recent studies have demonstrated vast structural and functional heterogeneity along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus, and while much is known about how the dorsal hippocampus processes spatial-temporal content, much less is known about whether or not the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) partitions positive and negative experiences into distinct sets of cells. Here, we combine transgenic and all-virus based activity-dependent tagging strategies to visualize multiple valence-specific engrams in the vHPC and demonstrate two partially segregated, albeit physiologically similar, populations that respond to positive and negative experiences. Next, using an RNA Sequencing approach, we find that vHPC positive and negative cells display distinct transcriptional programs in which neurodegenerative- and neuroprotective-related gene sets are enriched, respectively. Additionally, while optogenetic manipulation of tagged cell bodies in vHPC is not sufficient to drive behavior, tagged vHPC terminals projecting to the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, but not the prefrontal cortex, have the capacity to drive preference and avoidance when stimulated, as well as to switch or reset their capacity to drive either, thereby demonstrating their flexible contributions to behavior. We conclude that the vHPC contains genetically, cellularly, and behaviorally distinct populations of cells processing positive and negative memory engrams. Together, our findings provide a novel means by which to visualize multiple engrams within the same brain and point to their unique genetic signatures as putative avenues for future therapeutic interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Shpokayte, Monika and McKissick, Olivia and Yuan, Bingbing and Rahsepar, Bahar and Fernandez, Fernando R and Ruesch, Evan A and Grella, Stephanie L and White, John A and Liu, X.

article,Siapas1998N,"Sleep is characterized by a structured combination of neuronal oscillations. In the hippocampus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is marked by high-frequency network oscillations (∼200 Hz ``ripples''), whereas neocortical SWS activity is organized into low-frequency delta (1--4 Hz) and spindle (7--14 Hz) oscillations. While these types of hippocampal and cortical oscillations have been studied extensively in isolation, the relationships between them remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate the existence of temporal correlations between hippocampal ripples and cortical spindles that are also reflected in the correlated activity of single neurons within these brain structures. Spindle--ripple episodes may thus constitute an important mechanism of cortico-hippocampal communication during sleep. This coactivation of hippocampal and neocortical pathways may be important for the process of memory consolidation, during which memories are gradually translated from short-term hippocampal to longer-term neocortical stores.",,,,,,,,,"Siapas, Athanassios G and Wilson, Matthew A",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL3NpYXBhczE5OThuLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w9zaWFwYXMxOTk4bi5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6c2lhcGFzMTk5OG4ucGRmAA4AIAAPAHMAaQBhAHAAYQBzADEAOQA5ADgAbgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9zaWFwYXMxOTk4bi5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-27 17:00:51 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80629-7,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,5,,,1123--1128,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Coordinated Interactions between Hippocampal Ripples and Cortical Spindles during Slow-Wave Sleep,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80629-7,21,1998,
article,Silberzahn2018AMPPS,"Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts' prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions.

article,Silva2015NN,"Replay of hippocampal place cell sequences has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. However, the standard interpretation of replay has been challenged by reports that similar activity is observed before experience ('preplay'). By the preplay account, pre-existing temporal sequences are mapped onto new experiences without learning sequential structure. Here we employed high density recording methods to monitor hundreds of place cells simultaneously while rats explored multiple novel environments. While we observed large numbers of synchronous spiking events before experience, they were not temporally correlated with subsequent experience. Multiple measures differentiated pre-experience and postexperience events that, taken together, defined the latter but not the former as trajectory-depicting. The formation of events with these properties was prevented by administration of an NMDA-receptor antagonist during experience. These results suggest that the sequential structure of behavioral episodes is encoded during experience and reexpressed as trajectory events.",,,,,,,,,"Silva, Delia and Feng, Ting and Foster, David J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-04 12:37:23 +0100,2020-04-07 14:10:22 +0200,,,10.1038/nn.4151,,,,,,,,,,,,1546-1726,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,12,,,1772--1779,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,koenigsberg,,Trajectory events across hippocampal place cells require previous experience,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4151,18,2015,
article,Silver2016N,"The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks'to evaluate board positions and `policy networks'to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.

article,Silver2008P2ICMLI,"We present a reinforcement learning architecture, Dyna-2, that encompasses both sample-based learning and sample-based search, and that generalises across states during both learning and search. We apply Dyna-2 to high performance Computer Go. In this domain the most successful planning methods are based on sample-based search algorithms, such as UCT, in which states are treated individually, and the most successful learning methods are based on temporal-difference learning algorithms, such as Sarsa, in which linear function approximation is used. In both cases, an estimate of the value function is formed, but in the first case it is transient, computed and then discarded after each move, whereas in the second case it is more permanent, slowly accumulating over many moves and games. The idea of Dyna-2 is for the transient planning memory and the permanent learning memory to remain separate, but for both to be based on linear function approximation and both to be updated by Sarsa. To apply Dyna-2 to 9x9 Computer Go, we use a million binary features in the function approximator, based on templates matching small fragments of the board. Using only the transient memory, Dyna-2 performed at least as well as UCT. Using both memories combined, it significantly outperformed UCT.

article,Sinclair2019TN,"Memories are readily distorted. What conditions allow memories to be altered? Converging evidence implicates prediction error, or surprise, as a key mechanism that renders memories malleable. Recent reconsolidation studies have used incomplete reminders to elicit prediction error; retrieval cues that partially replicate an encoding experience allow memories to be distorted, updated, and strengthened. Here, we review diverse evidence that incomplete reminders govern human memory updating, ranging from classical conditioning to naturalistic episodes. Through the unifying theme of predictive coding, we discuss evidence from reconsolidation theory and nonmonotonic plasticity. We argue that both animal and human reconsolidation research can benefit from critically examining prediction error and incomplete reminders.

Here we show that there is greater coordinated neural activity during SWRs preceding correct, as compared to incorrect, trials in a spatial alternation task. As a result, the proportion of cell pairs coactive during SWRs was predictive of subsequent correct or incorrect responses on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect was seen specifically during early learning, when the hippocampus is essential for task performance.

Here, we show that rat hippocampal CA3 principal cells are significantly more active during SWRs following receipt of reward.

This relation was reliably stronger for sleep after the behavioral session than before it; thus, the activity during sleep reflects changes produced by experience.

article,Skaggs2007JN,"Neural unit activity and EEGs were recorded from inferior temporal regions of three rhesus macaques chronically implanted with ``hyperdrives'' holding 12 individually movable tetrodes. Recordings were made from each monkey over a period of ∼3 mo, while the electrodes were moved by small increments through the hippocampus and neighboring structures. After recording, the monkeys were necropsied, and the brains were sectioned and Nissl-stained, permitting identification of individual electrode tracks. The results establish that hippocampal pyramidal cells are ``complex spike cells,'' firing at overall average rates of ∼0.3 Hz, with spike trains consisting of long periods of silence interspersed with bursts of activity. The results also establish that the monkey hippocampal EEG shows ``sharp wave'' events consisting of a high-frequency ``ripple'' oscillation (∼110 Hz) together with a large slow-wave EEG deflection lasting several hundred milliseconds. The evidence suggests that monkey sharp waves are probably generated mainly in the CA1 region and that sharp waves are associated with an inactive/drowsy-or-sleeping behavioral state, which is also associated with increased hippocampal pyramidal cell activity and increased hippocampal EEG amplitude. The results of this initial study of ensembles of primate hippocampal neurons are consistent with previous studies in rodents and consistent with the hypothesis that theories and models of hippocampal memory function developed on the basis of rat data may be applicable to a wide range of mammalian species.",,,,,,,,,"Skaggs, William E. and McNaughton, Bruce L. and Permenter, Michele and Archibeque, Matthew and Vogt, Julie and Amaral, David G. and Barnes, Carol A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-15 14:12:09 +0200,2020-04-15 14:12:28 +0200,,,10.1152/jn.00401.2007,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-1598,,,Journal of Neurophysiology,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,2,,,898--910,,,,American Physiological Society,,,,,,,,EEG Sharp Waves and Sparse Ensemble Unit Activity in the Macaque Hippocampus,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00401.2007,98,2007,

article,Sols2017CB,"Although everyday experiences unfold continuously over time, shifts in context, or event boundaries, can influence how those events come to be represented in memory [1, 2, 3, 4]. Specifically, mnemonic binding across sequential representations is more challenging at context shifts, such that successful temporal associations are more likely to be formed within than across contexts [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, in order to preserve a subjective sense of continuity, it is important that the memory system bridge temporally adjacent events, even if they occur in seemingly distinct contexts. Here, we used pattern similarity analysis to scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during a sequential learning task [2, 3] in humans and showed that the detection of event boundaries triggered a rapid memory reinstatement of the just-encoded sequence episode. Memory reactivation was detected rapidly (∼200--800 ms from the onset of the event boundary) and was specific to context shifts that were preceded by an event sequence with episodic content. Memory reinstatement was not observed during the sequential encoding of events within an episode, indicating that memory reactivation was induced specifically upon context shifts. Finally, the degree of neural similarity between neural responses elicited during sequence encoding and at event boundaries correlated positively with participants' ability to later link across sequences of events, suggesting a critical role in binding temporally adjacent events in long-term memory. Current results shed light onto the neural mechanisms that promote episodic encoding not only for information within the event, but also, importantly, in the ability to link across events to create a memory representation of continuous experience.",,,,,,,,,"Sols, Ignasi and DuBrow, Sarah and Davachi, Lila and Fuentemilla, Llu{\'\i}s",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-28 11:52:20 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2017.09.057,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,22,,,3499--3504.e4,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Event Boundaries Trigger Rapid Memory Reinstatement of the Prior Events to Promote Their Representation in Long-Term Memory,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.09.057,27,2017,
article,Solway2014PCB,"In order to accomplish everyday tasks, we often divide them up into subtasks: to make spaghetti, we (1) get out a pot, (2) fill it with water, (3) bring the water to a boil, and so forth. But how do we learn to subdivide our goals in this way? Work from computer science suggests that the way a task is subdivided or decomposed can have a dramatic impact on how easy the task is to accomplish: certain decompositions speed learning and planning compared to others.

article,Sommer2019JN,"Age-related memory decline is associated with changes in neural functioning, but little is known about how aging affects the quality of information representation in the brain. Whereas a long-standing hypothesis of the aging literature links cognitive impairments to less distinct neural representations in old age (``neural dedifferentiation''), memory studies have shown that overlapping neural representations of different studied items are beneficial for memory performance. In an electroencephalography (EEG) study, we addressed the question whether distinctiveness or similarity between patterns of neural activity supports memory differentially in younger and older adults. We analyzed between-item neural pattern similarity in 50 younger (19--27 years old) and 63 older (63--75 years old) male and female human adults who repeatedly studied and recalled scene--word associations using a mnemonic imagery strategy. We compared the similarity of spatiotemporal EEG frequency patterns during initial encoding in relation to subsequent recall performance. The within-person association between memory success and pattern similarity differed between age groups: For older adults, better memory performance was linked to higher similarity early in the encoding trials, whereas young adults benefited from lower similarity between earlier and later periods during encoding, which might reflect their better success in forming unique memorable mental images of the joint picture--word pairs.

article,Sommer2020B,"Our memories depend on our brain's ability to form internal representations of relevant aspects of the world that can later be retrieved. The specificity with which past experiences can be remembered varies across the lifespan, possibly due to differences in how precisely information is encoded. This memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered (suppressed or enhanced) when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan age differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition specificity. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7--9 years), young adults (18--30 years), and older adults (65--76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, old, similar, and new objects were presented, allowing for a differentiation of memory for the specific item versus the general category. We identified neural repetition suppression effects in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects. These brain--behavior associations did not differ between age groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. In sum, our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect encoding mechanisms that facilitate the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.",,,,,,,,,"Sommer, Verena R. and Mount, Luzie and Weigelt, Sarah and Werkle-Bergner, Markus and Sander, Myriam C.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 08:26:16 +0100,2020-10-27 08:27:04 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.09.14.295972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,jan,,,,,,2020.09.14.295972,,,,,,,,,,,,Memory specificity is linked to repetition effects in event-related potentials across the lifespan,,,,,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/14/2020.09.14.295972.abstract,,2020,

Both dorsal and ventral hippocampus (dH and vH) project to the NAc, but it remains unknown whether dH and vH act in concert or separately to engage NAc representations related to space and reward. We recorded simultaneously from the dH, vH, and NAc of rats during an appetitive spatial task and focused on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) to identify times of memory reactivation across brain regions. Here, we show that dH and vH awake SWRs occur asynchronously and activate distinct and opposing patterns of NAc spiking. Only NAc neurons activated during dH SWRs were tuned to task- and reward-related information. These temporally and anatomically separable hippocampal-NAc interactions point to distinct channels of mnemonic processing in the NAc, with the dH-NAc channel specialized for spatial task and reward information.

article,Spano2020CB,"The hippocampus plays a critical role in sleep-related memory processes but it is unclear which specific sleep features are dependent upon this brain structure. The examination of sleep physiology in patients with focal bilateral hippocampal damage and amnesia could supply important evidence regarding these links. However, there is a dearth of such studies, despite these patients providing compelling insights into awake cognition. Here, we sought to identify the contribution of the hippocampus to the sleep phenotype by characterizing sleep via comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses in memory-impaired patients with selective bilateral hippocampal damage and matched control participants using in-home polysomnography on 4 nights. We found that, compared to control participants, patients had significantly reduced slow-wave sleep---likely due to decreased density of slow waves---as well as slow-wave activity. In contrast, slow and fast spindles were indistinguishable from those of control participants. Moreover, patients expressed slow oscillations (SOs), and SO-fast spindle coupling was observed. However, on closer scrutiny, we noted that the timing of spindles within the SO cycle was delayed in the patients. The shift of patients' spindles into the later phase of the up-state within the SO cycle may indicate a mismatch in timing across the SO-spindle-ripple events that are associated with memory consolidation.The substantial effect of selective bilateral hippocampal damage on large-scale oscillatory activity in the cortex suggests that, as with awake cognition, the hippocampus plays a significant role in sleep physiology, which may, in turn, be necessary for efficacious episodic memory.",,,,,,,,,"Span{\`o}, Goffredina and Weber, Frederik D. and Pizzamiglio, Gloria and McCormick, Cornelia and Miller, Thomas D. and Rosenthal, Clive R. and Edgin, Jamie O. and Maguire, Eleanor A.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-17 14:14:59 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2019.11.072,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Sleeping with Hippocampal Damage,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.11.072,,2020,

Topographical memory was tested by assessing his ability to navigate, recognize previously visited locations, and draw maps of the town. Episodic memory was assessed by testing the retrieval of simulated events which consisted of collecting objects from characters while following a route through the virtual town. Memory for the identity of objects, as well as for where they were collected, from whom, and in what order, was also tested. While the first task tapped simple recognition memory, the latter three tested memory for context. Jon was impaired on all topographical tasks and on his recall of the context‐dependent questions. However, his recognition of objects from the virtual town, and of ``topographical'' scenes (as evaluated by standard neuropsychological tests), was not impaired.

A central thesis is that work with rats, monkeys, and humans---which has sometimes seemed to proceed independently in 3 separate literatures---is now largely in agreement about the function of the hippocampus and related structures. A biological perspective is presented, which proposes multiple memory systems with different functions and distinct anatomical organizations. The hippocampus (together with anatomically related structures) is essential for a specific kind of memory, here termed declarative memory (similar terms include explicit and relational). Declarative memory is contrasted with a heterogeneous collection of nondeclarative (implicit) memory abilities that do not require the hippocampus (skills and habits, simple conditioning, and the phenomenon of priming).

article,Staba2002JN,"High-frequency oscillations (100--200 Hz), termed ripples, have been identified in hippocampal (Hip) and entorhinal cortical (EC) areas of rodents and humans. In contrast, higher-frequency oscillations (250--500 Hz), termed fast ripples (FR), have been described in seizure-generating limbic areas of rodents made epileptic by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and observed in humans ipsilateral to areas of seizure initiation. However, quantitative studies supporting the existence of two spectrally distinct oscillatory events have not been carried out in humans nor has the preferential appearance of FR within seizure generating areas received statistical evaluation based on analysis of a large sample of oscillatory events. Interictal oscillations within the bandwidth of 80--500 Hz were detected in Hip and EC areas of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy using wideband EEG recorded during non-rapid eye-movement sleep from chronically implanted depth electrodes. Power spectral analysis showed that oscillations detected from Hip and EC areas were composed of two spectrally distinct groups. The lower-frequency ripple group was defined by a frequency of 96 $\pm$ 14 Hz (median $\pm$ width), while the higher-frequency FR group had a frequency of 262 $\pm$ 59 Hz. FR oscillations were significantly shorter in duration compared with ripple oscillations (P < 0.0001). In regard to the occurrence of FR and ripples in epileptic Hip and EC, the mean ratio of the number of FR to ripples generated in areas ipsilateral to seizure onset was significantly higher compared with the mean ratio of FR to ripple generation from contralateral areas (P = 0.008). Furthermore, sites ipsilateral to seizure onset with hippocampal atrophy had significantly higher ratios compared with sites contralateral to both seizure onset and hippocampal atrophy (P = 0.001). These data provide compelling quantitative and statistical evidence for the existence of two spectrally distinct groups of limbic oscillations that have frequency and duration characteristics similar to those previously described in epileptic rat and human Hip and EC. The strong association between FR and regions of seizure initiation supports the view that FR reflects pathological hypersynchronous events crucially associated with seizure genesis.",,,,,,,,,"Staba, Richard J. and Wilson, Charles L. and Bragin, Anatol and Fried, Itzhak and Engel, Jerome",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-09-19 17:45:32 +0200,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1152/jn.2002.88.4.1743,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-1598,,,Journal of Neurophysiology,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,4,,,1743--1752,,,,American Physiological Society,,,,,,ripples,,Quantitative Analysis of High-Frequency Oscillations (80--500 Hz) Recorded in Human Epileptic Hippocampus and Entorhinal Cortex,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.2002.88.4.1743,88,2002,
article,Stachenfeld2017NN,"A cognitive map has long been the dominant metaphor for hippocampal function, embracing the idea that place cells encode a geometric representation of space. However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial.

phdthesis,Stachenfeld2018PU,"RL has been transformative for neuroscience by providing a normative anchor for interpreting neural and behavioral data. End-to-end RL methods have scored impressive victories with minimal compromises in autonomy, hand-engineering, and generality. The cost of this minimalism in practice is that model-free RL methods are slow to learn and generalize poorly. Humans and animals exhibit substantially improved flexibility and generalize learned information rapidly to new environment by learning invariants of the environment and features of the environment that support fast learning rapid transfer in new environments. An important question for both neuroscience and machine learning is what kind of representational objectives'' encourage humans and other animals to encode structure about the world. This can be formalized as representation feature learning,'' in which the animal or agent learns to form representations with information potentially relevant to the downstream RL process. We will overview different representational objectives that have received attention in neuroscience and in machine learning. The focus of this overview will be to first highlight conditions under which these seemingly unrelated objectives are actually mathematically equivalent. We will use this to motivate a breakdown of properties of different learned representations that are meaningfully different and can be used to inform contrasting hypotheses for neuroscience. We then use this perspective to motivate our model of the hippocampus. A cognitive map has long been the dominant metaphor for hippocampal function, embracing the idea that place cells encode a geometric representation of space. However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity, and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We approach the problem of understanding hippocampal representations from a reinforcement learning perspective, focusing on what kind of spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward. We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. We go on to argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensional basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning.",,,,,,,,,"Stachenfeld, Kimberly Lauren",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-27 12:30:15 +0100,2021-01-27 12:35:11 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Princeton University,,,Grid Cell; Hippocampus; Place Cell; Reinforcement Learning; Representation Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Princeton University,,,,,Learning Neural Representations That Support Efficient Reinforcement Learning,,,,,http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01qb98mj16v,,2018,
article,Stalnaker2019E,"Dopamine neurons respond to errors in predicting value-neutral sensory information. These data, combined with causal evidence that dopamine transients support sensory-based associative learning, suggest that the dopamine system signals a multidimensional prediction error. Yet such complexity is not evident in the activity of individual neurons or population averages. How then do downstream areas know what to learn in response to these signals? One possibility is that information about content is contained in the pattern of firing across many dopamine neurons. Consistent with this, here we show that the pattern of firing across a small group of dopamine neurons recorded in rats signals the identity of a mis-predicted sensory event. Further, this same information is reflected in the BOLD response elicited by sensory prediction errors in human midbrain. These data provide evidence that ensembles of dopamine neurons provide highly specific teaching signals, opening new possibilities for how this system might contribute to learning.",,,,,,,,,"Stalnaker, Thomas A and Howard, James D and Takahashi, Yuji K and Gershman, Samuel J and Kahnt, Thorsten and Schoenbaum, Geoffrey",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-12 09:13:57 +0100,2020-12-11 11:52:26 +0100,,,10.7554/elife.49315,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,eLife,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,,,,,,,,"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd",,,,,,,,Dopamine neuron ensembles signal the content of sensory prediction errors,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49315,8,2019,
incollection,Stangl2019S,"The groundbreaking discovery of grid cells in the rodent medial entorhinal cortex has led to unparalleled understanding of the neural underpinnings of spatial navigation. These cells show remarkably regular firing patterns, with neighboring firing fields arranged in 60$\,^{\circ}$ intervals, and it has been suggested that they provide the spatial metric underlying different cognitive functions, from path integration to the organization of conceptual knowledge. The physiological properties of grid cells mean that the putative signature of these neurons can be observed at the macroscopic level in the blood oxygenation level-dependent response using functional magnetic resonance imaging and local field potentials from intracranial implant patients. In this chapter, we provide a step-by-step guide as to the methods used to assess the activity from populations of grid cells (i.e., grid-cell-like representations) in humans, from the preprocessing of data to the calculation of grid cell metrics.

Mechanistically, consolidation processes have been hypothesized to rely on systematic interactions between the three cardinal neuronal oscillations characterizing non--rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Under global control of de- and hyperpolarizing slow oscillations (SOs), sleep spindles may cluster hippocampal ripples for a precisely timed transfer of local information to the neocortex. We used direct intracranial electroencephalogram recordings from human epilepsy patients during natural sleep to test the assumption that SOs, spindles and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. Employing cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses, we found that spindles were modulated by the up-state of SOs.

In our current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we systematically controlled the extent to which a target and an event detail have to be integrated across spatiotemporal discontiguities during associative memory formation. Although the encoding task, the type of association, and subsequent memory performance were held constant, engagement of the hippocampus during successful associative binding was directly modulated by increases in spatial and temporal discontiguities across episodic elements.

Here, using human single neuron recordings, we show that hippocampal firing rates are elevated from ~ 500--1500 ms after cue onset during successful associative retrieval. Concurrently, the retrieved target object can be decoded from population spike patterns in adjacent entorhinal cortex (EC), with hippocampal firing preceding EC spikes and predicting the fidelity of EC object reinstatement.

The temporal difference (TD) learning model has been a cornerstone in understanding how dopamine RPEs could drive associative learning. Classically, TD learning imparts value to features that serially track elapsed time relative to observable stimuli. In the real world, however, sensory stimuli provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment, leading to the proposal that TD learning might instead compute a value signal based on an inferred distribution of hidden states (a 'belief state'). Here we asked whether dopaminergic signaling supports a TD learning framework that operates over hidden states.

article,Staudigl2015JN,"A powerful force in human memory is the context in which memories are encoded (Tulving and Thomson, 1973). Several studies suggest that the reinstatement of neural encoding patterns is beneficial for memory retrieval (Manning et al., 2011; Staresina et al., 2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014). However, reinstatement of the original encoding context is not always helpful, for instance, when retrieving a memory in a different contextual situation (Smith and Vela, 2001). It is an open question whether such context-dependent memory effects can be captured by the reinstatement of neural patterns. We investigated this question by applying temporal and spatial pattern similarity analysis in MEG and intracranial EEG in a context-match paradigm.

article,Staudigl2013CB,"Human episodic memory is highly context dependent. Therefore, retrieval benefits when a memory is recalled in the same context compared to a different context [1, 2]. This implies that items and contexts are bound together during encoding, such that the reinstatement of the initial context at test improves retrieval. Animal studies suggest that theta oscillations and theta-to-gamma cross-frequency coupling modulate such item-context binding [3], but direct evidence from humans is scarce. We investigated this issue by manipulating the overlap of contextual features between encoding and retrieval. Participants studied words superimposed on movie clips and were later tested by presenting the word with either the same or a different movie. The results show that memory performance and the oscillatory correlates of memory formation crucially depend on the overlap of the context between encoding and test. When the context matched, high theta power during encoding was related to successful recognition, whereas the opposite pattern emerged in the context-mismatch condition. In addition, cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed a context-dependent theta-to-gamma memory effect specifically in the left hippocampus. These results reveal for the first time that context-dependent episodic memory effects are mediated by theta oscillatory activity.",,,,,,,,,"Staudigl, Tobias and Hanslmayr, Simon",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-24 08:30:04 +0200,2020-08-24 08:30:34 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,jun,,,12,,,1101--1106,,,,Elsevier {BV},,,,,,,,Theta Oscillations at Encoding Mediate the Context-Dependent Nature of Human Episodic Memory,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cub.2013.04.074,23,2013,

It is thought that only fixed, behaviorally relevant patterns can be reactivated, which are stored across hippocampal synaptic connections. To test whether some generalized rules govern reactivation, we examined trajectory reactivation following non-stereotypical exploration of familiar open-field environments. We found that random trajectories of varying lengths and timescales were reactivated, resembling that of Brownian motion of particles. The animals' behavioral trajectory did not follow Brownian diffusion demonstrating that the exact behavioral experience is not reactivated. Therefore, hippocampal circuits are able to generate random trajectories of any recently active map by following diffusion dynamics. This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning.",,,,,,,,,"Stella, Federico and Baracskay, Peter and O'Neill, Joseph and Csicsvari, Jozsef",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL3N0ZWxsYTIwMTluLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w9zdGVsbGEyMDE5bi5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6c3RlbGxhMjAxOW4ucGRmAA4AIAAPAHMAdABlAGwAbABhADIAMAAxADkAbgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy9zdGVsbGEyMDE5bi5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 18:36:04 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.052,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,2,,,450--461,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Hippocampal Reactivation of Random Trajectories Resembling Brownian Diffusion,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.052,102,2019,

Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26%.

article,Stoianov2020B,"We advance a novel computational theory of the hippocampal formation as a hierarchical generative model that organizes sequential experiences, such as rodent trajectories during spatial navigation, into coherent spatiotemporal contexts. We propose that to make this possible, the hippocampal generative model is endowed with strong inductive biases to pattern-separate individual items of experience (at the first hierarchical layer), organize them into sequences (at the second layer) and then cluster them into maps (at the third layer). This theory entails a novel characterization of hippocampal reactivations as generative replay: the offline resampling of fictive sequences from the generative model, for the sake of continual learning of multiple sequential experiences. Our experiments show that the hierarchical model using generative replay is able to learn and retain efficiently multiple spatial navigation trajectories, organizing them into separate spatial maps. Furthermore, it reproduces flexible aspects of hippocampal dynamics that have been challenging to explain within existing frameworks. This theory reconciles multiple roles of the hippocampal formation in map-based navigation, episodic memory and imagination.",,,,,,,,,"Stoianov, Ivilin and Maisto, Domenico and Pezzulo, Giovanni",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAbLi4vcGFwZXJzL3N0b2lhbm92MjAyMGIucGRmTxEBbgAAAAABbgACAAAFbWFjT1MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEJEAAH/////EXN0b2lhbm92MjAyMGIucGRmAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP////8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAAAKIGN1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZwYXBlcnMAAgBALzpVc2Vyczp3aXR0a3VobjpEb2N1bWVudHM6YmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5OnBhcGVyczpzdG9pYW5vdjIwMjBiLnBkZgAOACQAEQBzAHQAbwBpAGEAbgBvAHYAMgAwADIAMABiAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPlVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL3N0b2lhbm92MjAyMGIucGRmABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEIAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABtA==,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-24 10:40:28 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.01.16.908889,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,replay; modeling,,The hippocampal formation as a hierarchical generative model supporting generative replay and continual learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.16.908889,,2020,

The relative size of spatial representation by place cells in the rat hippocampus gradually increases from dorsal to ventral.By contrast, rodent gene expression studies demonstrate multiple long-axis functional domains with sharply demarcated borders: at least nine in CA3 and three in CA1 and the dentate gyrus.Hippocampal intrinsic anatomical connectivity, as well as electrophysiological measures of coherence, show abrupt division from the ventral (anterior) one-third to dorsal (posterior) two-thirds of the hippocampus.Hippocampal involvement in unconditioned fear responses is limited to the ventral one-third.When these levels of organization are superimposed, a new model of hippocampal long-axis organization emerges: gradients with discrete domains, the latter dividing the hippocampus into (at least) three portions along the long axis.This model supersedes a simple dissociation of the dorsal from the ventral hippocampus and provides a potential framework for accommodating the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus in rodents and primates.",,,,,,,,,"Strange, Bryan A. and Witter, Menno P. and Lein, Ed S. and Moser, Edvard I.",,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,,,,,,,,,2014/10/01,,2021-01-26 08:43:08 +0100,2021-01-26 08:43:26 +0100,,,10.1038/nrn3785,,,,,,,,,Strange2014,,1471-0048,,,,Nature Reviews Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,655--669,,,,,,,,,,,,Functional organization of the hippocampal longitudinal axis,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3785,15,2014,
article,Studte2017BL,"The consolidation of new associations is thought to depend in part on physiological processes engaged during non-REM (NREM) sleep, such as slow oscillations and sleep spindles. Moreover, NREM sleep is thought to selectively benefit associations that are adaptive for the future. In line with this, the current study investigated whether different reward cues at encoding are associated with changes in sleep physiology and memory retention. Participants' associative memory was tested after learning a list of arbitrarily paired words both before and after taking a 90-min nap. During learning, word-pairs were preceded by a cue indicating either a high or a low reward for correct memory performance at test. The motivation manipulation successfully impacted retention such that memory declined to a greater extent from pre- to post sleep for low rewarded than for high rewarded word-pairs. In line with previous studies, positive correlations between spindle density during NREM sleep and general memory performance pre- and post-sleep were found. In addition to this, however, a selective positive relationship between memory performance for highly rewarded word-pairs at posttest and spindle density during NREM sleep was also observed. These results support the view that motivationally salient memories are preferentially consolidated and that sleep spindles may be an important underlying mechanism for selective consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Studte, Sara and Bridger, Emma and Mecklinger, Axel",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 16:43:14 +0100,2020-12-14 16:43:33 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2016.03.003,,,,,,,,,,,,0093-934X,,,Brain and Language,,,"Sleep spindles, Nap, Motivation, Reward, Recognition memory",,,,,,,,,,Sleep and language learning,,,,28 - 35,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep spindles during a nap correlate with post sleep memory performance for highly rewarded word-pairs,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X15301516,167,2017,
article,Sugden2020NN,"Salient experiences are often relived in the mind. Human neuroimaging studies suggest that such experiences drive activity patterns in visual association cortex that are subsequently reactivated during quiet waking. Nevertheless, the circuit-level consequences of such reactivations remain unclear. Here, we imaged hundreds of neurons in visual association cortex across days as mice learned a visual discrimination task. Distinct patterns of neurons were activated by different visual cues. These same patterns were subsequently reactivated during quiet waking in darkness, with higher reactivation rates during early learning and for food-predicting versus neutral cues. Reactivations involving ensembles of neurons encoding both the food cue and the reward predicted strengthening of next-day functional connectivity of participating neurons, while the converse was observed for reactivations involving ensembles encoding only the food cue.

We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus of freely behaving mice that had a forebrain-specific knockout of the synaptic plasticity-mediating phosphatase calcineurin and were previously shown to exhibit behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, recapitulating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Calcineurin knockout (KO) mice exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in the abundance of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events during awake resting periods and single units in KO were overactive during SWR events. Pairwise measures of unit activity, however, revealed that the sequential reactivation of place cells during SWR events was completely abolished in KO. Since this relationship during postexperience awake rest periods has been implicated in learning, working memory, and subsequent memory consolidation, our findings provide a mechanism underlying impaired information processing that may contribute to the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.",,,,,,,,,"Suh, Junghyup and Foster, David J. and Davoudi, Heydar and Wilson, Matthew A. and Tonegawa, Susumu",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-01 12:16:40 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2013.09.014,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,2,,,484--493,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,replay; disorders,,Impaired Hippocampal Ripple-Associated Replay in a Mouse Model of Schizophrenia,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2013.09.014,80,2013,

It draws upon diverse themes in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, machine learning and artificial intelligence research. We begin by posing broad questions. What are brains for, and what does it mean to ask how they ``work''? Then, over a series of lectures, we discuss parallel computational approaches in machine learning/AI and psychology/neuroscience, including reinforcement learning, deep learning, and Bayesian methods. We contrast computational and representational approaches to understanding neuroscience data. We ask whether current approaches in machine learning are feasible and scaleable, and which methods -- if any -- resemble the computations observed in biological brains. We review how high-level cognitive functions -- attention, episodic memory, concept formation, reasoning and executive control -- are being instantiated in artificial agents, and how their implementation draws upon what we know about the mammalian brain.

article,Sun2020NN,"The brain codes continuous spatial, temporal and sensory changes in daily experience. Recent studies suggest that the brain also tracks experience as segmented subdivisions (events), but the neural basis for encoding events remains unclear. Here, we designed a maze for mice, composed of four materially indistinguishable lap events, and identify hippocampal CA1 neurons whose activity are modulated not only by spatial location but also lap number. These `event-specific rate remapping' (ESR) cells remain lap-specific even when the maze length is unpredictably altered within trials, which suggests that ESR cells treat lap events as fundamental units. The activity pattern of ESR cells is reused to represent lap events when the maze geometry is altered from square to circle, which suggests that it helps transfer knowledge between experiences. ESR activity is separately manipulable from spatial activity, and may therefore constitute an independent hippocampal code: an `event code' dedicated to organizing experience by events as discrete and transferable units.",,,,,,,,,"Sun, Chen and Yang, Wannan and Martin, Jared and Tonegawa, Susumu",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-06 20:29:38 +0200,2020-04-06 20:30:14 +0200,,,10.1038/s41593-020-0614-x,,,,,,,,,,,,1546-1726,,,Nature Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,hippocampus,,Hippocampal neurons represent events as transferable units of experience,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0614-x,,2020,

article,Sutton1999AI,"Learning, planning, and representing knowledge at multiple levels of temporal abstraction are key, longstanding challenges for AI. In this paper we consider how these challenges can be addressed within the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of action in this framework to include options---closed-loop policies for taking action over a period of time. Examples of options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a distant city, as well as primitive actions such as muscle twitches and joint torques. Overall, we show that options enable temporally abstract knowledge and action to be included in the reinforcement learning framework in a natural and general way. In particular, we show that options may be used interchangeably with primitive actions in planning methods such as dynamic programming and in learning methods such as Q-learning. Formally, a set of options defined over an MDP constitutes a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and the theory of SMDPs provides the foundation for the theory of options. However, the most interesting issues concern the interplay between the underlying MDP and the SMDP and are thus beyond SMDP theory. We present results for three such cases: (1) we show that the results of planning with options can be used during execution to interrupt options and thereby perform even better than planned, (2) we introduce new intra-option methods that are able to learn about an option from fragments of its execution, and (3) we propose a notion of subgoal that can be used to improve the options themselves. All of these results have precursors in the existing literature; the contribution of this paper is to establish them in a simpler and more general setting with fewer changes to the existing reinforcement learning framework. In particular, we show that these results can be obtained without committing to (or ruling out) any particular approach to state abstraction, hierarchy, function approximation, or the macro-utility problem.",,,,,,,,,"Sutton, Richard S. and Precup, Doina and Singh, Satinder",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-19 12:57:40 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/s0004-3702(99)00052-1,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-3702,,,Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,1-2,,,181--211,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Between {MDPs} and {semi-MDPs}: A framework for temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00052-1,112,1999,

article,Suzuki2011JCN,"fMRI (1.5 mm isotropic voxels) was employed to investigate the relationship between hippocampal activity and memory strength in a continuous recognition task. While being scanned, subjects were presented with colored photographs that each appeared on four occasions. The requirements were to make one response when an item was presented for the first or the third time and to make a different response when an item appeared for the second or the fourth time. Consistent with prior findings, items presented for the first time elicited greater hippocampal and parahippocampal activity than repeated items. The activity elicited by repeated items declined linearly as a function of number of presentations (``graded'' new > old effects). No medial-temporal lobe regions could be identified where activity elicited by repeated items exceeded that for new items or where activity elicited by repeated items increased with number of presentations. These findings are inconsistent with the proposal that retrieval-related hippocampal activity is positively correlated with memory strength. We also identified graded new > old effects in several cortical regions outside the medial-temporal lobe, including the left retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex and the right lateral occipito-temporal cortex.

article,Swanson2020COBS,"Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWR) are thought to mediate brain-wide reactivation of memory traces in service of memory consolidation. However, rather than the faithful replay of neural activity observed during a specific experience, reactivation in both the hippocampus and downstream regions is more variable. We suggest that variable reactivation is a unifying feature of recurrent brain circuits. In the hippocampus, self-organized activation during offline states is constrained by existing attractor manifolds, or maps, and may be biased toward particular mapped locations by salient experience, which results in the appearance of experience-specific replay. Similarly, the impact of SWR-associated reactivation on downstream regions is not a simple transfer of hippocampal representational content. Rather, the response of downstream regions depends on a transformation function, defined by both the feedforward and local circuit architecture, as well as the `listening state' of the downstream region. We hypothesize that SWRs act as a multiplexed signal, the mnemonic specificity of which is largely determined by this transformation function, and discuss the implications of this framing for theories of systems consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Swanson, Rachel A and Levenstein, Daniel and McClain, Kathryn and Tingley, David and Buzs{\'a}ki, Gy{\""o}rgy",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-27 13:45:20 +0100,2020-10-27 13:45:47 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2020.02.008,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-1546,,,Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,Understanding memory: Which level of analysis?,,,,126 - 135,,,,,,,,,,,,Variable specificity of memory trace reactivation during hippocampal sharp wave ripples,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300280,32,2020,

Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made.

Here, we used high-field, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis to determine the spatial scales at which orientation-selective information can be found in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats and humans. We applied a multiscale pattern analysis approach in which fine- and coarse-scale signals were first removed by ideal spatial lowpass and highpass filters, and the residual activity patterns then analyzed by linear classifiers. Cat visual cortex, imaged at 0.3125 mm resolution, showed a strong orientation signal at the scale of individual columns. Nonetheless, reliable orientation bias could still be found at spatial scales of several millimeters. In the human visual cortex, imaged at 1 mm resolution, a majority of orientation information was found on scales of millimeters, with small contributions from global spatial biases exceeding ∼1 cm. Our high-resolution imaging results demonstrate a reliable millimeters-scale orientation signal, likely emerging from irregular spatial arrangements of orientation columns and their supporting vasculature. fMRI pattern analysis methods are thus likely to be sensitive to signals originating from other irregular columnar structures elsewhere in the brain.",,,,,,,,,"Swisher, J.

article,Tabuchi2003H,"To investigate the involvement of the hippocampal-accumbens system in goal-oriented displacement behaviors, hippocampal neuronal activity was recorded in rats learning and recalling new distributions of different volumes of liquid reward among the arms of a plus maze. Each arm had a reward box containing a water trough and identical visual cues that could be illuminated independently. As the water-restricted rat successively visited the respective boxes, it received 7, 5, and 3 drops of water, and then 1 drop, provided at 1-s intervals. (Reward distributions were reassigned daily and mid-session.) In the training phase, reward boxes were lit individually. In the recall phase, the lamps on all arms were lit and then turned off as the rat visited the boxes in order of descending value. Neuronal firing rates were analyzed for changes related to reward value or to shifts between learning and recall phases. The principal finding is that place responses remained unchanged after these manipulations and that these neurons showed no evidence of explicit coding of reward value. In addition, two other types of responses appeared while the rat was stationary at the reward boxes awaiting multiple rewards. These were observed primarily in neurons within the dentate gyrus, but also in CA1. Position-selective reward site responses were regular at 20--60 impulses per second, while position-independent discharges bursted irregularly at about 5 impulses per second. Such responses could explain controversial reports of reward dependence in hippocampal neurons. The higher incidence of the latter responses in the temporal (``ventral'') hippocampus is consistent with the distinctive anatomical and functional properties of this subregion.

Using a subtask switching protocol in which the animal experienced three subtasks as `what' information in a maze, I here show that the replay represents a trial type, consisting of path and subtask, in terms of neuronal firing timings and rates. The actual trial type to be rewarded could only be reliably predicted from replays that occurred at the decision point.

article,Takashima2009JN,"The standard model of system-level consolidation posits that the hippocampus is part of a retrieval network for recent memories. According to this theory, the memories are gradually transferred to neocortical circuits with consolidation, where the connections within this circuit grow stronger and reorganized so that redundant and/or contextual details may be lost. Thus, remote memories are based on neocortical networks and can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus. To test this model, we measured regional brain activity and connectivity during retrieval with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were trained on two sets of face--location association and were tested with two different delays, 15 min and 24 h including a whole night of sleep. We hypothesized that memory traces of the locations associated with specific faces will be linked through the hippocampus for the retrieval of recently learned association, but with consolidation, the activity and the functional connectivity between the neocortical areas will increase. We show that posterior hippocampal activity related to high-confidence retrieval decreased and neocortical activity increased with consolidation. Moreover, the connectivity between the hippocampus and the neocortical regions decreased and in turn, cortico-cortical connectivity between the representational areas increased. The results provide mechanistic support for a two-level process of the declarative memory system, involving initial representation of new associations in a network including the hippocampus and subsequent consolidation into a predominantly neocortical network.",,,,,,,,,"Takashima, A. and Nieuwenhuis, I.

However, it remains unclear whether learning is facilitated by non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or by REM sleep, whether it results from plasticity increases or stabilization, and whether facilitation results from learning-specific processing. Here, we trained volunteers on a visual task and measured the excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance in early visual areas during subsequent sleep as an index of plasticity. The E/I balance increased during NREM sleep irrespective of whether pre-sleep learning occurred, but it was associated with post-sleep performance gains relative to pre-sleep performance. In contrast, the E/I balance decreased during REM sleep but only after pre-sleep training, and the decrease was associated with stabilization of pre-sleep learning.

article,Tambini2017SR,"Reactivation of representations corresponding to recent experience is thought to be a critical mechanism supporting long-term memory stabilization. Targeted memory reactivation, or the re-exposure of recently learned cues, seeks to induce reactivation and has been shown to benefit later memory when it takes place during sleep. However, despite recent evidence for endogenous reactivation during post-encoding awake periods, less work has addressed whether awake targeted memory reactivation modulates memory. Here, we found that brief (50 ms) visual stimulus re-exposure during a repetitive foil task enhanced the stability of cued versus uncued associations in memory. The extent of external or task-oriented attention prior to re-exposure was inversely related to cueing benefits, suggesting that an internally-orientated state may be most permissible to reactivation. Critically, cueing-related memory benefits were greatest in participants without explicit recognition of cued items and remained reliable when only considering associations not recognized as cued, suggesting that explicit cue-triggered retrieval processes did not drive cueing benefits. Cueing benefits were strongest for associations and participants with the poorest initial learning.

article,Tambini2020CB,"Stable representations of past experience are thought to depend on processes that unfold after events are initially encoded into memory. Post-encoding reactivation and hippocampal-cortical interactions are leading candidate mechanisms thought to support memory retention and stabilization across hippocampal-cortical networks. Although putative consolidation mechanisms have been observed during sleep and periods of awake rest, the direct causal contribution of awake consolidation mechanisms to later behavior is unclear, especially in humans. Moreover, it has been argued that observations of putative consolidation processes are epiphenomenal and not causally important, yet there are few tools to test the functional contribution of these mechanisms in humans. Here, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and fMRI to test the role of awake consolidation processes by targeting hippocampal interactions with lateral occipital cortex (LOC). We applied theta-burst TMS to LOC (and a control site) to interfere with an extended window (approximately 30--50 min) after memory encoding. Behaviorally, post-encoding TMS to LOC selectively impaired associative memory retention compared to multiple control conditions. In the control TMS condition, we replicated prior reports of post-encoding reactivation and memory-related hippocampal-LOC interactions during periods of awake rest using fMRI. However, post-encoding LOC TMS reduced these processes, such that post-encoding reactivation in LOC and memory-related hippocampal-LOC functional connectivity were no longer present. By targeting and manipulating post-encoding neural processes, these findings highlight the direct contribution of awake time periods to episodic memory consolidation.

Moreover, multiple measures of emotion-related brain activity showed evidence of reinstatement during subsequent periods of neutral stimulus encoding. Both slow neural fluctuations (low-frequency connectivity) and transient, stimulus-evoked activity predictive of trial-by-trial memory formation present during emotional encoding were reinstated during subsequent neutral encoding.

article,Tang2019NN,"A fundamental cognitive process is to map value and identity onto the objects we learn about. However, what space best embeds this mapping is not completely understood. Here we develop tools to quantify the space and organization of such a mapping in neural responses as reflected in functional MRI, to show that quick learners have a higher dimensional representation than slow learners, and hence more easily distinguishable whole-brain responses to objects of different value. Furthermore, we find that quick learners display more compact embedding of their neural responses, and hence have higher ratios of their stimuli dimension to their embedding dimension, which is consistent with greater efficiency of cognitive coding. Lastly, we investigate the neurophysiological drivers at smaller scales and study the complementary distinguishability of whole-brain responses.

article,Tang2017JN,"Hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events occur during both behavior (awake SWRs) and slow-wave sleep (sleep SWRs). Awake and sleep SWRs both contribute to spatial learning and memory, thought to be mediated by the coordinated reactivation of behavioral experiences in hippocampal-cortical circuits seen during SWRs. Current hypotheses suggest that reactivation contributes to memory consolidation processes, but whether awake and sleep reactivation are suited to play similar or different roles remains unclear. Here we addressed that issue by examining the structure of hippocampal (area CA1) and prefrontal (PFC) activity recorded across behavior and sleep stages in male rats learning a spatial alternation task. We found a striking state difference: prefrontal modulation during awake and sleep SWRs was surprisingly distinct, with differing patterns of excitation and inhibition. CA1-PFC synchronization was stronger during awake SWRs, and spatial reactivation, measured using both pairwise and ensemble measures, was more structured for awake SWRs compared with post-task sleep SWRs. Stronger awake reactivation was observed despite the absence of coordination between network oscillations, namely hippocampal SWRs and cortical delta and spindle oscillations, which is prevalent during sleep. Finally, awake CA1-PFC reactivation was enhanced most prominently during initial learning in a novel environment, suggesting a key role in early learning. Our results demonstrate significant differences in awake and sleep reactivation in the hippocampal-prefrontal network. These findings suggest that awake SWRs support accurate memory storage and memory-guided behavior, whereas sleep SWR reactivation is better suited to support integration of memories across experiences during consolidation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) occur both in the awake state during behavior and in the sleep state after behavior. Awake and sleep SWRs are associated with memory reactivation and are important for learning, but their specific memory functions remain unclear. Here, we found profound differences in hippocampal-cortical reactivation during awake and sleep SWRs, with key implications for their roles in memory. Awake reactivation is a higher-fidelity representation of behavioral experiences, and is enhanced during early learning, without requiring coordination of network oscillations that is seen during sleep. Our findings suggest that awake reactivation is ideally suited to support initial memory formation, retrieval and planning, whereas sleep reactivation may play a broader role in integrating memories across experiences during consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"Tang, Wenbo and Shin, Justin D. and Frank, Loren M. and Jadhav, Shantanu P.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-22 14:28:30 +0100,2020-12-22 14:28:54 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2291-17.2017,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/49/11789.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49,,,11789--11805,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Hippocampal-Prefrontal Reactivation during Learning Is Stronger in Awake Compared with Sleep States,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/49/11789,37,2017,
article,Tang2020B,"Neural activity underlying decision making has been reported in many brain regions in the form of choice-specific neuronal sequences that span entire task periods. In contrast to this behavioral-timescale activity, recent work has raised the possibility of fast-timescale decision-making activity in hippocampal and prefrontal regions. Whether these are distinct or complementary mechanisms is unknown. Here, we examined simultaneous hippocampal and prefrontal ensemble activity during learning of a spatial working-memory decision task. We found that both regions formed choice-specific sequences at the behavioral timescale (~seconds), as well as two fast timescales (~100-200 ms), theta cycles during navigation and sharp-wave ripples in inter-trial periods. Behavioral-timescale sequences maintained representations of current goals during navigation. In contrast, at the fast timescales, hippocampal sequences supported deliberation, whereas prefrontal ensembles predicted actual choices. Error trials resulted from impaired interaction between behavioral- and fast-timescale mechanisms. These results establish cooperative interaction at multiple timescales for memory-guided decision making.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Tang, Wenbo and Shin, Justin D. and Jadhav, Shantanu P.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 10:22:17 +0100,2020-10-26 10:22:44 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.10.17.343699,,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/17/2020.10.17.343699.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Multiple time-scales of decision making in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/17/2020.10.17.343699,,2020,
article,Taube1990JN,"The discharge characteristics of postsubicular head-direction cells in a fixed environment were described in the previous paper (Taube et al., 1990). This paper reports changes in the firing properties of head- direction cells following changes in the animal{\textquoteright}s environment. Head- direction cells were recorded from rats as they moved freely in a 76-cm- diameter gray cylinder. A white card, occupying 100 degrees of arc, was taped to the inside wall of the cylinder and served as the major orienting spatial cue in the animal{\textquoteright}s environment. Rotation of the cue card produced near-equal rotation in the preferred firing direction of head-direction cells, with minimal changes in peak firing rate, directional firing range, or asymmetry of the firing-rate/head- direction function. Card removal had no effect on peak firing rate or range of firing, but in 8/13 cells the preferred direction rotated by at least 24 degrees. Similarly, changing the shape of the environment to a rectangular or square enclosure caused the preferred firing direction to rotate by at least 48 degrees for 8/10 cells in the rectangle and 3/8 cells in the square, with minimal changes in the peak firing rate or directional firing range. Hand holding the animals and moving them around the cylinder had no effect on the preferred direction or firing range of the cell, but decreased the maximal firing rate in 7/9 cells. On 2 occasions, 2 head-direction cells were recorded simultaneously. The rotation of the preferred firing direction for one cell was the same as the rotation of the preferred direction for the second cell after each environmental manipulation. These results demonstrate that specific visual cues in the environment can exert control over the preferred firing direction and indicate that head- direction cell firing is not a simple sensory response to visual cues, but rather represents more abstract information concerning the animal{\textquoteright}s spatial relationship with its environment. The constancy of the angle between the preferred firing directions of pairs of simultaneously recorded head-direction cells suggests that there is a fixed mapping of the population onto direction within the environment. Thus, environmental manipulations appear to cause only a change in the reference direction, but leave all other discharge characteristics of directional cells unchanged. In the discussion, comparisons are drawn between the responses of head-direction cells and hippocampal place cells to similar environmental manipulations (Muller and Kubie, 1987), and ways in which these 2 spatial systems interact in navigation are discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,"Taube, JS and Muller, RU and Ranck, JB",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-15 18:20:35 +0100,2021-01-15 18:20:51 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-02-00436.1990,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/10/2/436.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,436--447,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Head-direction cells recorded from the postsubiculum in freely moving rats.

article,Tennant2016F,"Ongoing debates surrounding Open Access to the scholarly literature are multifaceted and complicated by disparate and often polarised viewpoints from engaged stakeholders. At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources, and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However, Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing.

article,Tennant2020S,"There is no clear-cut boundary between Free and Open Source Software and Open Scholarship, and the histories, practices, and fundamental principles between the two remain complex. In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.",,,,,,,,,"Tennant, Jonathan and Agarwal, Ritwik and Ba{\v{z}}dari{\'{c}}, Ksenija and Brassard, David and Crick, Tom and Dunleavy, Daniel J. and Evans, Thomas Rhys and Gardner, Nicholas and Gonzalez-Marquez, Monica and Graziotin, Daniel and Tzovaras, Bastian Greshake and Gunnarsson, Daniel and Havemann, Johanna and Hosseini, Mohammad and Katz, Daniel S. and Kn{\""o}chelmann, Marcel and Madan, Christopher R and Manghi, Paolo and Marocchino, Alberto and Masuzzo, Paola and Murray-Rust, Peter and Narayanaswamy, Sanjay and Nilsonne, Gustav and Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel and Penders, Bart and Pourret, Olivier and Rera, Michael and Samuel, John and Steiner, Tobias and Stojanovski, Jadranka and Uribe-Tirado, Alejandro and Vos, Rutger and Worthington, Simon and Yarkoni, Tal",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-02 14:00:39 +0100,2020-12-02 14:01:32 +0100,,,10.31235/osf.io/2kxq8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SocArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,mar,,,,,,,,,,Center for Open Science,,,,,,,,A tale of two {\textquotesingle}opens{\textquotesingle}: intersections between Free and Open Source Software and Open Scholarship,,,,,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2kxq8,,2020,

Arguably the most elusive aspect of intelligence is the ability to make robust inferences that go far beyond one's experience. Animals categorize objects, learn to vocalize and may even estimate causal relationships --- all in the face of data that is often ambiguous and sparse. Such inductive leaps are thought to result from the brain's ability to infer latent structure that governs the environment. However, we know little about the neural computations that underlie this ability.

article,Tessereau2020B,"Humans and non-human animals show great flexibility in spatial navigation, including the ability to return to specific locations based on as few as one single experience. To study spatial navigation in the laboratory, watermaze tasks, in which rats have to find a hidden platform in a pool of cloudy water surrounded by spatial cues, have long been used. Analogous tasks have been developed for human participants using virtual environments. Spatial learning in the watermaze is facilitated by the hippocampus. In particular, rapid, one-trial, allocentric place learning, as measured in the Delayed-Matching-to-Place (DMP) variant of the watermaze task, which requires rodents to learn repeatedly new locations in a familiar environment, is hippocampal dependent. In this article, we review some computational principles, embedded within a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, that utilise hippocampal spatial representations for navigation in watermaze tasks. We consider which key elements underlie their efficacy, and discuss their limitations in accounting for hippocampus-dependent navigation, both in terms of behavioural performance (i.e., how well do they reproduce behavioural measures of rapid place learning) and neurobiological realism (i.e., how well do they map to neurobiological substrates involved in rapid place learning). We discuss how an actor-critic architecture, enabling simultaneous assessment of the value of the current location and of the optimal direction to follow, can reproduce one-trial place learning performance as shown on watermaze and virtual DMP tasks by rats and humans, respectively, if complemented with map-like place representations. The contribution of actor-critic mechanisms to DMP performance is consistent with neurobiological findings implicating the striatum and hippocampo-striatal interaction in DMP performance, given that the striatum has been associated with actor-critic mechanisms. Moreover, we illustrate that hierarchical computations embedded within an actor-critic architecture may help to account for aspects of flexible spatial navigation. The hierarchical RL approach separates trajectory control via a temporal-difference error from goal selection via a goal prediction error and may account for flexible, trial-specific, navigation to familiar goal locations, as required in some arm-maze place memory tasks, although it does not capture one-trial learning of new goal locations, as observed in open field, including watermaze and virtual, DMP tasks. Future models of one-shot learning of new goal locations, as observed on DMP tasks, should incorporate hippocampal plasticity mechanisms that integrate new goal information with allocentric place representation, as such mechanisms are supported by substantial empirical evidence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Tessereau, Charline and O{\textquoteright}Dea, Reuben and Coombes, Stephen and Bast, Tobias",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 07:53:23 +0100,2020-10-29 07:53:46 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.07.30.229005,,,,,2020.07.30.229005,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/08/04/2020.07.30.229005.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Reinforcement Learning approaches to hippocampus-dependant flexible spatial navigation,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/08/04/2020.07.30.229005,,2020,

Episodic retrieval supports the ability to simulate future experiences by providing access to episodic details (e.g., the people and locations that comprise memories) that can be recombined in new ways. In the current functional neuroimaging study, we test this hypothesis by examining whether the hippocampus, a region implicated in the reinstatement of episodic information during memory, supports reinstatement of episodic information during simulation. Employing a multivoxel pattern similarity analysis, we interrogated the similarity between hippocampal neural patterns during memory and simulation at the level of individual event details.

A key question in neuroscience is whether its spatial coding principles also provide a universal metric for the organization of non-spatial information. Initial evidence comes from studies revealing directional modulation of fMRI responses in humans [6, 7] during navigation through abstract spaces and the involvement of place and grid cells in encoding of non-spatial feature dimensions [8]. However, a critical feature of a map-like representation is information about distances between locations, which has yet only been demonstrated for physical space [4, 9]. Here, we probe whether the hippocampus similarly encodes distances between points in an abstract space spanned by continuous stimulus-feature dimensions that were relevant to the acquisition of a novel concept. We find that, after learning, two-dimensional distances between individual positions in the abstract space were represented in the hippocampal multivoxel pattern as well as in the univariate hippocampal signal as indexed by fMRI adaptation.

Previous work demonstrated directional coding during navigation through a continuous stimulus feature space as well as mapping of distances in a feature space that was relevant for concept learning. Here we provide the first unambiguous evidence for a hippocampal representation of the actual concept space, by showing that the hippocampal distance signal selectively reflects the mapping of specifically conceptually relevant rather than of all feature dimensions. During fMRI scanning of 32 human participants (21 females), we presented everyday objects, which had beforehand been associated with specific values on three continuous feature dimensions. Crucially, only two dimensions were relevant to prior concept learning. We find that hippocampal responses to the objects reflect their relative distances in a space defined along conceptually relevant dimensions compared with distances in a space defined along all feature dimensions.

Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120--180 Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output.

article,Todorova2020H,"Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes are transient events of highly synchronous neuronal activity that typically occur during ``offline'' brain states. This endogenous surge of activity consists of behaviorally relevant spiking patterns, describing spatial trajectories. They have been shown to play a critical role in memory consolidation during sleep and in navigational planning during wakefulness. Beyond their local impact on the hippocampal formation, ripples also exert direct and indirect effects on target cortical and subcortical areas, which are thought to play a key role in information processing and semantic network reconfiguration. We review research into the function of hippocampal sharp waves-ripples, with a special focus on information flow between the hippocampus and its cortical and subcortical targets.

article,Tolman1938PR,"An analysis of the complex of causal determinants on which a rat's behavior of turning right or left depends shows them to be divided into ""environmental variables,"" such as maintenance schedule, appropriate goal-object, types of stimuli provided and responses required, number of trials, pattern of maze preceding and following the choice; and ""individual difference variables,"" as heredity, age, previous training, and special endocrine and other conditions. Tolman suggests a set of ""intervening variables"" or theoretical constructs to replace the ""stimuli, connections, and response tendencies"" of Thorndike, and the added ""conditioning, goal-gradients, and anticipatory goal responses"" of Hull, which he considers too associationistic and oversimplified. Instead, he offers ""demands,"" ""appetites,"" ""differentiation,"" ""motor skill,"" ""hypotheses,"" and ""biases,"" and quotes defining experiments which have already validated each of these. He assumes that these factors summate not in an algebraic manner, but in more complicated ways, some of which are clarified by Lewin's vector analysis methods. Finally he considers certain anticipatory types of behavior labeled ""V.T.E.,"" vicarious trial-and-error, which, under favorable conditions, interact with the intervening variables.

The conditions which favor (cognitive) narrow strip-maps and which favor broad comprehensive maps in rats and in men are considered. Narrow strip-maps seem to be indicated by (1) a damaged brain, (2) an inadequate arrangement of environmentally presented cues, (3) a surplus of repetitions on the original trained-on path, and (4) the presence of too strongly frustrating conditions. The fourth point is elaborated. It is contended that some of the psychological mechanisms which clinical psychologists and other students of personality have uncovered as factors underlying many individual and social maladjustments can be interpreted ""as narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or to too intense frustrations.""",,,,,,,,,"Tolman, Edward C.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-15 16:28:20 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1037/h0061626,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-295X,,,Psychological Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,189--208,,,,American Psychological Association (APA),,,,,,cognitive map,,Cognitive maps in rats and men,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0061626,55,1948,

article,Tomatsu2008NR,"Which brain sites represent the final form of motor commands that encode temporal patterns of muscle activities? Here, we show the possible brain sites which have activity equivalent to the motor commands with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that short-temporal patterns of movements or stimuli are reflected in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses and we searched for regions representing the response. Participants performed two temporal patterns of tapping and/or listened to the same patterns of auditory stimuli in a 3T fMRI. The patterns were designed to have the same number (11) of events and the same duration, but different temporal distribution of events. The 11 events were divided into two parts (10 repetitive taps and one stand-alone tap) and the interval of the two parts was 3 s. The two patterns had reverse order of the two parts. The results revealed that different temporal patterns of auditory stimuli were represented in different temporal features of BOLD responses in the bilateral auditory cortex, whereas different temporal patterns of tapping were reflected in contralateral primary motor cortex and the ipsilateral anterior cerebellum. In bilateral premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, visual cortex, and posterior cerebellum, task-related BOLD responses were exhibited, but their responses did not reflect the temporal patterns of the movement and/or stimuli. One possible explanation is that the neuronal activities were similar for the two patterns in these regions. The sensitivity of the BOLD response to the temporal patterns reflects local differences in functional contributions to the tasks. The present experimental design and analysis may be useful to reveal particular brain regions that participate in multiple functions.",,,,,,,,,"Tomatsu, Saeka and Someya, Yoshiaki and Sung, Yul-Wan and Ogawa, Seiji and Kakei, Shinji",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-08-07 13:56:52 +0200,2020-08-07 13:57:16 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neures.2008.08.003,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-0102,,,Neuroscience Research,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,3,,,160--167,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Temporal feature of BOLD responses varies with temporal patterns of movement,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2008.08.003,62,2008,

article,Tompary2017N,"Summary Structured knowledge is thought to form, in part, through the extraction and representation of regularities across overlapping experiences. However, little is known about how consolidation processes may transform novel episodic memories to reflect such regularities. In a multi-day fMRI study, participants encoded trial-unique associations that shared features with other trials. Multi-variate pattern analyses were used to measure neural similarity across overlapping and non-overlapping memories during immediate and 1-week retrieval of these associations. We found that neural patterns in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex represented the featural overlap across memories, but only after a week. Furthermore, after a week, the strength of a memory's unique episodic reinstatement during retrieval was inversely related to its representation of overlap, suggesting a trade-off between the integration of related memories and recovery of episodic details. These findings suggest that consolidation-related changes in neural representations support the gradual organization of discrete episodes into structured knowledge.",,,,,,,,,"Tompary, Alexa and Davachi, Lila",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 16:17:32 +0100,2020-10-26 16:17:56 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.09.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neuron,,,memory consolidation; human fMRI; hippocampus; medial prefrontal cortex; pattern similarity,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,228--241.e5,,,,,,,,,,,,Consolidation Promotes the Emergence of Representational Overlap in the Hippocampus and Medial Prefrontal Cortex,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317308401,96,2017,

Analyses of brain activity patterns can reveal what a person is seeing, perceiving, attending to, or remembering. Moreover, multidimensional models can be used to investigate how the brain encodes complex visual scenes or abstract semantic information. Such feats of ``brain reading'' or ``mind reading,'' though impressive, raise important conceptual, methodological, and ethical issues. What does successful decoding reveal about the cognitive functions performed by a brain region? How should brain signals be spatially selected and mathematically combined to ensure that decoding reflects inherent computations of the brain rather than those performed by the decoder?

article,Toribio-Florez2021FRMA,"Open science (OS) is of paramount importance for the improvement of science worldwide and across research fields. Recent years have witnessed a transition toward open and transparent scientific practices, but there is still a long way to go. Early career researchers (ECRs) are of crucial relevance in the process of steering toward the standardization of OS practices, as they will become the future decision makers of the institutional change that necessarily accompanies this transition. Thus, it is imperative to gain insight into where ECRs stand on OS practices. Under this premise, the Open Science group of the Max Planck PhDnet designed and conducted an online survey to assess the stance toward OS practices of doctoral candidates from the Max Planck Society. As one of the leading scientific institutions for basic research worldwide, the Max Planck Society provides a considerable population of researchers from multiple scientific fields, englobed into three sections: biomedical sciences, chemistry, physics and technology, and human and social sciences. From an approximate total population of 5,100 doctoral candidates affiliated with the Max Planck Society, the survey collected responses from 568 doctoral candidates. The survey assessed self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and implementation of different OS practices, namely, open access publications, open data, preregistrations, registered reports, and replication studies. ECRs seemed to hold a generally positive view toward these different practices and to be interested in learning more about them. Furthermore, we found that ECRs' knowledge and positive attitudes predicted the extent to which they implemented these OS practices, although levels of implementation were rather low in the past. We observed differences and similarities between scientific sections. We discuss these differences in terms of need and feasibility to apply these OS practices in specific scientific fields, but additionally in relation to the incentive systems that shape scientific communities. Lastly, we discuss the implications that these results can have for the training and career advancement of ECRs, and ultimately, for the consolidation of OS practices.",,,,,,,,,"Toribio-Fl{\'o}rez, Daniel and Anneser, Lukas and deOliveira-Lopes, Felipe Nathan and Pallandt, Martijn and Tunn, Isabell and Windel, Hendrik and",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-22 17:42:32 +0100,2021-01-22 17:42:49 +0100,,,10.3389/frma.2020.586992,,,,,,,,,,,,2504-0537,,,Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,Where Do Early Career Researchers Stand on Open Science Practices?

Grid cells from a common module exhibit stable offsets in their periodic spatial tuning curves across environments, and this may reflect recurrent connectivity or correlated sensory inputs. Here we explore whether cell--cell relationships predicted by attractor models persist during sleep states in which spatially informative sensory inputs are absent. We recorded ensembles of grid cells in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex during active exploratory behaviors and overnight sleep. Per grid cell pair and collectively, and across waking, rapid eye movement sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, we found preserved patterns of spike-time correlations that reflected the spatial tuning offsets between these grid cells during active exploration. The preservation of cell--cell relationships across waking and sleep states was not explained by theta oscillations or activity in hippocampal subregion CA1.

article,Treves1992H,"The CA3 network in the hippocampus may operate as an autoassociator, in which declarative memories, known to be dependent on hippocampal processing, could be stored, and subsequently retrieved, using modifiable synaptic efficacies in the CA3 recurrent collateral system. On the basis of this hypothesis, the authors explore the computational relevance of the extrinsic afferents to the CA3 network. A quantitative statistical analysis of the information that may be relayed by such afferent connections reveals the need for two distinct systems of input synapses. The synapses of the first system need to be strong(but not associatively modifiable) in order to force, during learning, the CA3 cells into a pattern of activity relatively independent of any inputs being received from the recurrent collaterals, and which thus reflects sizable amounts of new information. It is proposed that the mossy fiber system performs this function.

article,Treves1994H,"The authors draw together the results of a series of detailed computational studies and show how they are contributing to the development of a theory of hippocampal function. A new part of the theory introduced here is a quantitative analysis of how backprojections from the hippocampus to the neocortex could lead to the recall of recent memories. The theory is then compared with other theories of hippocampal function. First, what is computed by the hippocampus is considered. The hypothesis the authors advocate, on the basis of the effects of damage to the hippocampus and neuronal activity recorded in it, is that it is involved in the formation of new memories by acting as an intermediate‐term buffer store for information about episodes, particularly for spatial, but probably also for some nonspatial, information. The authors analyze how the hippocampus could perform this function, by producing a computational theory of how it operates, based on neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information about the different neuronal systems contained within the hippocampus. Key hypotheses are that the CA3 pyramidal cells operate as a single autoassociation network to store new episodic information as it arrives via a number of specialized preprocessing stages from many association areas of the cerebral cortex, and that the dentate granule cell/mossy fiber system is important, particularly during learning, to help to produce a new pattern of firing in the CA3 cells for each episode. The computational analysis shows how many memories could be stored in the hippocampus and how quickly the CA3 autoassociation system would operate during recall. The analysis is then extended to show how the CA3 system could be used to recall a whole episodic memory when only a fragment of it is presented. It is shown how this recall could operate using modified synapses in backprojection pathways from the hippocampus to the cerebral neocortex, resulting in reinstatement of neuronal activity in association areas of the cerebral neocortex similar to that present during the original episode. The recalled information in the cerebral neocortex could then be used by the neocortex in the formation of long‐term memories.

article,Trimper2017FSN,"At rest, hippocampal ``place cells,'' neurons with receptive fields corresponding to specific spatial locations, reactivate in a manner that reflects recently traveled trajectories. These ``replay'' events have been proposed as a mechanism underlying memory consolidation, or the transfer of a memory representation from the hippocampus to neocortical regions associated with the original sensory experience. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that hippocampal replay of a particular experience should be accompanied by simultaneous reactivation of corresponding representations in the neocortex and in the entorhinal cortex, the primary interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex. Recent studies have reported that coordinated replay may occur between hippocampal place cells and medial entorhinal cortex grid cells, cells with multiple spatial receptive fields. Assessing replay in grid cells is problematic, however, as the cells exhibit regularly spaced spatial receptive fields in all environments and, therefore, coordinated replay between place cells and grid cells may be detected by chance. In the present report, we adapted analytical approaches utilized in recent studies of grid cell and place cell replay to determine the extent to which coordinated replay is spuriously detected between grid cells and place cells recorded from separate rats. For a subset of the employed analytical methods, coordinated replay was detected spuriously in a significant proportion of cases in which place cell replay events were randomly matched with grid cell firing epochs of equal duration. More rigorous replay evaluation procedures and minimum spike count requirements greatly reduced the amount of spurious findings. These results provide insights into aspects of place cell and grid cell activity during rest that contribute to false detection of coordinated replay. The results further emphasize the need for careful controls and rigorous methods when testing the hypothesis that place cells and grid cells exhibit coordinated replay.",,,,,,,,,"Trimper, John B. and Trettel, Sean G. and Hwaun, Ernie and Colgin, Laura Lee",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-28 12:15:02 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.3389/fnsys.2017.00057,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5137,,,Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,,,Methodological Caveats in the Detection of Coordinated Replay between Place Cells and Grid Cells,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2017.00057,11,2017,
article,Tryon2017H,"Distinguishing spatial contexts is likely essential for the well-known role of the hippocampus in episodic memory. We studied whether types of hippocampal neural organization thought to underlie context discrimination are impacted by learned economic considerations of choice behavior. Hippocampal place cells and theta activity were recorded as rats performed a maze-based probability discounting task that involved choosing between a small certain reward or a large probabilistic reward. Different spatial distributions of place fields were observed in response to changes in probability, the outcome of the rats' choice, and whether or not rats were free to make that choice. The degree to which the reward location was represented by place cells scaled with the expected probability of rewards. Theta power increased around the goal location also in proportion to the expected probability of signaled rewards. Furthermore, theta power dynamically varied as specific econometric information was obtained ``on the fly'' during task performance. Such an economic perspective of memory processing by hippocampal place cells expands our view of the nature of context memories retrieved by hippocampus during adaptive navigation.",,,,,,,,,"Tryon, Valerie L. and Penner, Marsha R. and Heide, Shawn W. and King, Hunter O. and Larkin, Joshua and Mizumori, Sheri J.

article,Tulving2002ARP,"Episodic memory is a neurocognitive (brain/mind) system, uniquely different from other memory systems, that enables human beings to remember past experiences.

It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks.

Statistical learning allows us to extract and represent these regularities, but how this knowledge is used by the brain during ongoing perception is unclear. We used rapid event-related fMRI to measure hemodynamic responses to individual visual images in a continuous stream that contained sequential contingencies. Sixteen human observers encountered these statistical regularities while performing an unrelated cognitive task, and were unaware of their existence. Nevertheless, the right anterior hippocampus showed greater hemodynamic responses to predictive stimuli, providing evidence for implicit anticipation as a consequence of unsupervised statistical learning. Hippocampal anticipation based on predictive stimuli correlated with subsequent processing of the predicted stimuli in occipital and parietal cortex, and anticipation in additional brain regions correlated with facilitated object recognition as reflected in behavioral priming. Additional analyses suggested that implicit perceptual anticipation does not contribute to explicit familiarity, but can result in predictive potentiation of category-selective ventral visual cortex.

This unsupervised learning occurs without intent or awareness, but little is known about how it relates to other types of learning, how it affects perceptual processing, and how quickly it can occur. Here we use fMRI during statistical learning to explore these questions. Participants viewed statistically structured versus unstructured sequences of shapes while performing a task unrelated to the structure. Robust neural responses to statistical structure were observed, and these responses were notable in four ways: First, responses to structure were observed in the striatum and medial temporal lobe, suggesting that statistical learning may be related to other forms of associative learning and relational memory. Second, statistical regularities yielded greater activation in category-specific visual regions (object-selective lateral occipital cortex and word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex), demonstrating that these regions are sensitive to information distributed in time. Third, evidence of learning emerged early during familiarization, showing that statistical learning can operate very quickly and with little exposure. Finally, neural signatures of learning were dissociable from subsequent explicit familiarity, suggesting that learning can occur in the absence of awareness.

article,Turker2019MC,"Memory for the items one has recently encountered is sometimes enhanced in divided attention tasks: Attending to behaviorally relevant items, such as a target in a detection task, boosts memory for unrelated background items (e.g., scenes or words). However, a central feature of episodic memory is memory for the spatiotemporal relationship between items and other elements of an event (relational memory), not just the item itself. Three experiments examined whether attending to a behaviorally relevant target-item boosts memory for the relationship between that item, its features, and a background scene. Participants memorized briefly presented scenes. At the same time, they pressed a button if a second unrelated item (a figure or face) was a particular target color (Experiments 1 and 2) or target gender (Experiment 3) rather than a distractor color or gender. Target and distractor items also varied in task-irrelevant features (shape, location, or facial identity). If attending to behaviorally relevant events influences relational memory, then participants should be better able to report both target-defining and irrelevant features of items that appeared with target-paired scenes rather than distractor-paired scenes. This was the case in all experiments: memory was enhanced for the target-paired scenes as well as the association between a scene and features of the paired target-item. Attending to behaviorally relevant moments therefore has broader effects on memory encoding than previously thought. In addition to boosting memory for unrelated background items, attending to targets facilitates relational memory in these tasks.",,,,,,,,,"Turker, Hamid B. and Swallow, Khena M.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAaLi4vcGFwZXJzL3R1cmtlcjIwMTltYy5wZGZPEQFsAAAAAAFsAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8QdHVya2VyMjAxOW1jLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAD8vOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOnR1cmtlcjIwMTltYy5wZGYAAA4AIgAQAHQAdQByAGsAZQByADIAMAAxADkAbQBjAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPVVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL3R1cmtlcjIwMTltYy5wZGYAABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEEAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABsQ==,,,,,,,,,2019/01/01,,2020-11-30 13:58:58 +0100,2020-11-30 13:59:17 +0100,,,10.3758/s13421-018-0846-0,,,,,,,,,Turker2019,,1532-5946,,,,Memory \& Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1--16,,,,,,,,,,,,Attending to behaviorally relevant moments enhances incidental relational memory,JOUR,,,,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-018-0846-0,47,2019,

article,Uria2020B,"In the mammalian brain, allocentric representations support efficient self-location and flexible navigation. A number of distinct populations of these spatial responses have been identified but no unified function has been shown to account for their emergence. Here we developed a network, trained with a simple predictive objective, that was capable of mapping egocentric information into an allocentric spatial reference frame. The prediction of visual inputs was sufficient to drive the appearance of spatial representations resembling those observed in rodents: head direction, boundary vector, and place cells, along with the recently discovered egocentric boundary cells, suggesting predictive coding as a principle for their emergence in animals. The network learned a solution for head direction tracking convergent with known biological connectivity, while suggesting a possible mechanism of boundary cell remapping. Moreover, like mammalian representations, responses were robust to environmental manipulations, including exposure to novel settings, and could be replayed in the absence of perceptual input, providing the means for offline learning. In contrast to existing reinforcement learning approaches, agents equipped with this network were able to flexibly reuse learnt behaviours - adapting rapidly to unfamiliar environments. Thus, our results indicate that these representations, derived from a simple egocentric predictive framework, form an efficient basis-set for cognitive mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Uria, Benigno and Ibarz, Borja and Banino, Andrea and Zambaldi, Vinicius and Kumaran, Dharshan and Hassabis, Demis and Barry, Caswell and Blundell, Charles",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-15 12:10:17 +0100,2020-12-15 12:10:44 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.11.11.378141,,,,,2020.11.11.378141,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/12/2020.11.11.378141.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,The Spatial Memory Pipeline: a model of egocentric to allocentric understanding in mammalian brains,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/12/2020.11.11.378141,,2020,
article,Ugurbil2013N,"The Human Connectome Project (HCP) relies primarily on three complementary magnetic resonance (MR) methods. These are: 1) resting state functional MR imaging (rfMRI) which uses correlations in the temporal fluctuations in an fMRI time series to deduce `functional connectivity'; 2) diffusion imaging (dMRI), which provides the input for tractography algorithms used for the reconstruction of the complex axonal fiber architecture; and 3) task based fMRI (tfMRI), which is employed to identify functional parcellation in the human brain in order to assist analyses of data obtained with the first two methods. We describe technical improvements and optimization of these methods as well as instrumental choices that impact speed of acquisition of fMRI and dMRI images at 3 T, leading to whole brain coverage with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 0.7 s for fMRI, and 1.25 mm isotropic resolution dMRI data for tractography analysis with three-fold reduction in total dMRI data acquisition time. Ongoing technical developments and optimization for acquisition of similar data at 7 T magnetic field are also presented, targeting higher spatial resolution, enhanced specificity of functional imaging signals, mitigation of the inhomogeneous radio frequency (RF) fields, and reduced power deposition.

incollection,Vertes2019ANIPS,"Animals need to devise strategies to maximize returns while interacting with their environment based on incoming noisy sensory observations. Task-relevant states, such as the agent's location within an environment or the presence of a predator, are often not directly observable but must be inferred using available sensory information. Successor representations (SR) have been proposed as a middle-ground between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning strategies, allowing for fast value computation and rapid adaptation to changes in the reward function or goal locations. Indeed, recent studies suggest that features of neural responses are consistent with the SR framework. However, it is not clear how such representations might be learned and computed in partially observed, noisy environments. Here, we introduce a neurally plausible model using \emph{distributional successor features}, which builds on the distributed distributional code for the representation and computation of uncertainty, and which allows for efficient value function computation in partially observed environments via the successor representation. We show that distributional successor features can support reinforcement learning in noisy environments in which direct learning of successful policies is infeasible.",,,,,,,,,"V\'{e}rtes, Eszter and Sahani, Maneesh",,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,,,,,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32,,,,,,2020-05-08 14:11:56 +0200,2020-05-08 15:49:31 +0200,,,,,,"Wallach, H. and Larochelle, H. and Beygelzimer, A. and d\textquotesingle Alch\'{e}-Buc, F. and Fox, E. and Garnett, R.",,,,,,,,,,,,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13714--13724,,,,"Curran Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,A neurally plausible model learns successor representations in partially observable environments,,,,,http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9522-a-neurally-plausible-model-learns-successor-representations-in-partially-observable-environments.pdf,,2019,
article,Vahdat2017E,"Sleep is necessary for the optimal consolidation of newly acquired procedural memories. However, the mechanisms by which motor memory traces develop during sleep remain controversial in humans, as this process has been mainly investigated indirectly by comparing pre- and post-sleep conditions. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography during sleep following motor sequence learning to investigate how newly-formed memory traces evolve dynamically over time. We provide direct evidence for transient reactivation followed by downscaling of functional connectivity in a cortically-dominant pattern formed during learning, as well as gradual reorganization of this representation toward a subcortically-dominant consolidated trace during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Importantly, the putamen functional connectivity within the consolidated network during NREM sleep was related to overnight behavioral gains.

New evidence of habitual behavior in a drug choice setting are then described and discussed. Interestingly, habitual preference did not promote drug choice but instead favored abstinence. Here, we propose several clues to reconcile these unexpected results with the habit theory of addiction, and we highlight the need in experimental research to face the complexity of drug addicts'decision-making environments by investigating drug habits in the context of choice and in the presence of cues.

article,Vasconcelos2008BP,"Transitive inference has long been considered one of the hallmarks of human deductive reasoning. Recent reports of transitive-like behaviors in non-human animals have prompted a flourishing empirical and theoretical search for the mechanism(s) that may mediate this ability in non-humans. In this paper, I begin by describing the transitive inference tasks customarily used with non-human animals and then review the empirical findings. Transitive inference has been demonstrated in a wide variety of species, and the signature effects that usually accompany transitive inference in humans (the serial position effect and the symbolic distance effect) have also been found in non-humans. I then critically analyze the most prominent models of this ability in non-human animals. Some models are cognitive, proposing for instance that animals use the rules of formal logic or form mental representations of the premises to solve the task, others are based on associative mechanisms such as value transfer and reinforcement and non-reinforcement.

Therefore, it should be possible to reverse engineer a memory by artificially creating these patterns of activity in the absence of a sensory experience. In olfactory conditioning, an odor conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US; for example, a footshock), and the resulting CS--US association guides future behavior. Here we replaced the odor CS with optogenetic stimulation of a specific olfactory glomerulus and the US with optogenetic stimulation of distinct inputs into the ventral tegmental area that mediate either aversion or reward. In doing so, we created a fully artificial memory in mice. Similarly to a natural memory, this artificial memory depended on CS--US contingency during training, and the conditioned response was specific to the CS and reflected the US valence.

During sleep, the occurrence of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), believed to mediate consolidation of explicit memories, is modulated by thalamocortical network activity, yet how information is routed around SWRs and how this communication depends on neuronal dynamics remains unclear. Here, by simultaneously recording ensembles of neurons in the anterior thalamus and local field potentials in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, we show that the head-direction (HD) cells of the anterodorsal nucleus are set in stable directions immediately before SWRs. This response contrasts with other thalamic cells that exhibit diverse couplings to the hippocampus related to their intrinsic dynamics but independent of their anatomical location.

Yet limited direct evidence supports the link between planning and the hippocampal place map. We addressed this by investigating model-based planning and place memory in healthy controls and epilepsy patients treated using unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy with hippocampal resection. Both functions were impaired in the patient group. Specifically, the planning impairment was related to right hippocampal lesion size, controlling for overall lesion size. Furthermore, although planning and boundary-driven place memory covaried in the control group, this relationship was attenuated in patients, consistent with both functions relying on the same structure in the healthy brain.

article,Walther2016N,"Representational similarity analysis of activation patterns has become an increasingly important tool for studying brain representations. The dissimilarity between two patterns is commonly quantified by the correlation distance or the accuracy of a linear classifier. However, there are many different ways to measure pattern dissimilarity and little is known about their relative reliability. Here, we compare the reliability of three classes of dissimilarity measure: classification accuracy, Euclidean/Mahalanobis distance, and Pearson correlation distance. Using simulations and four real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, we demonstrate that continuous dissimilarity measures are substantially more reliable than the classification accuracy. The difference in reliability can be explained by two characteristics of classifiers: discretization and susceptibility of the discriminant function to shifts of the pattern ensemble between imaging runs. Reliability can be further improved through multivariate noise normalization for all measures. Finally, unlike conventional distance measures, crossvalidated distances provide unbiased estimates of pattern dissimilarity on a ratio scale, thus providing an interpretable zero point. Overall, our results indicate that the crossvalidated Mahalanobis distance is preferable to both the classification accuracy and the correlation distance for characterizing representational geometries.",,,,,,,,,"Walther, Alexander and Nili, Hamed and Ejaz, Naveed and Alink, Arjen and Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus and Diedrichsen, J{\""o}rn",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-03 13:11:48 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.12.012,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,188--200,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Reliability of dissimilarity measures for multi-voxel pattern analysis,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.12.012,137,2016,

article,Wang2020CB,"The cognitive map is often assumed to be a Euclidean map that isometrically represents the real world (i.e., the Euclidean distance between any two locations in the physical world should be preserved on the cognitive map). However, accumulating evidence suggests that environmental boundaries can distort the mental representations of physical space. For example, the distance between two locations can be remembered as longer than the true physical distance if the locations are separated by a boundary. While this overestimation is observed under different experimental conditions, even when the boundary is formed by flat surface cues, its physiological basis is not well understood. We examined the neural representation of flat surface cue boundaries, and of the space segregated by these boundaries, by recording place cell activity from CA1 and CA3 while rats foraged on a circular track or square platforms with inhomogeneous surface textures. About 40% of the place field edges concentrated near the boundaries on the circular track (significantly above the chance level 33%). Similarly, place field edges were more prevalent near boundaries on the platforms than expected by chance. In both one- and two-dimensional environments, the population vectors of place cell activity changed more abruptly with distance between locations that crossed cue boundaries than between locations within a bounded region. These results show that the locations of surface boundaries were evident as enhanced decorrelations of the neural representations of locations to either side of the boundaries. This enhancement might underlie the cognitive phenomenon of overestimation of distances across boundaries.",,,,,,,,,"Wang, Chia-Hsuan and Monaco, Joseph D. and Knierim, James J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-11 11:55:50 +0200,2020-06-11 11:56:11 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2020.01.083,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,8,,,1397--1409.e7,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Hippocampal Place Cells Encode Local Surface-Texture Boundaries,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.01.083,30,2020,
article,Wang2020B,"Decisions are typically guided by what we have experienced in the past. However, when direct experience is unavailable, animals and humans can imagine or infer the future to make choices. Outcome expectations that are based on direct experience and inference may compete for guiding behavior [1, 2], and they may recruit distinct but overlapping brain circuits [3-5]. In rodents, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contains neural signatures of inferred outcomes and is necessary for behavior that requires inference, but it is not necessary when responding can be based on direct experience [6-10]. In humans, OFC activity is also correlated with inferred outcome expectations [11, 12], but it is unclear whether the human OFC is selectively required for inference-based behavior. To test this, here we used non-invasive targeted continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) [13] to inactivate the human OFC in a sensory preconditioning task designed to isolate inference-based behavior from responding that can be based on direct experience [6, 12, 14]. We show that OFC-targeted cTBS disrupts reward-related behavior only in conditions in which outcome expectations have to be mentally inferred, but that it does not impair behavior that can be based on stimulus-outcome associations that were directly experienced. These findings suggest that OFC is necessary for decision making when outcomes have to be mentally simulated, providing converging cross-species evidence for a critical role of OFC in model-based but not model-free behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Wang, Fang and Howard, James D and Voss, Joel L and Schoenbaum, Geoffrey and Kahnt, Thorsten",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-27 09:13:47 +0200,2020-04-27 09:14:13 +0200,,,10.1101/2020.04.24.059808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,"Human orbitofrontal cortex is necessary for behavior based on inferred, not experienced outcomes",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059808,,2020,

Here, we used a sensory preconditioning task and pattern-based neuroimaging to study this question. We found that associations among value-neutral cues were acquired in both regions during preconditioning but that value-related information was only represented in the OFC at the time of the probe test. Importantly, inference was accompanied by representations of associated cues and inferred outcomes in the OFC, as well as by increased HPC--OFC connectivity.

article,Wang2012JN,"Fear is an emotional response to danger that is highly conserved throughout evolution because it is critical for survival. Accordingly, episodic memory for fearful locations is widely studied using contextual fear conditioning, a hippocampus-dependent task (Kim and Fanselow, 1992; Phillips and LeDoux, 1992). The hippocampus has been implicated in episodic emotional memory and is thought to integrate emotional stimuli within a spatial framework. Physiological evidence supporting the role of the hippocampus in contextual fear indicates that pyramidal cells in this region, which fire in specific locations as an animal moves through an environment, shift their preferred firing locations shortly after the presentation of an aversive stimulus (Moita et al., 2004). However, the long-term physiological mechanisms through which emotional memories are encoded by the hippocampus are unknown. Here we show that during and directly after a fearful experience, new hippocampal representations are established and persist in the long term. We recorded from the same place cells in mouse hippocampal area CA1 over several days during predator odor contextual fear conditioning and found that a subset of cells changed their preferred firing locations in response to the fearful stimulus. Furthermore, the newly formed representations of the fearful context stabilized in the long term. Our results demonstrate that place cells respond to the presence of an aversive stimulus, modify their firing patterns during emotional learning, and stabilize a long-term spatial representation in response to a fearful encounter. The persistent nature of these representations may contribute to the enduring quality of emotional memories.",,,,,,,,,"Wang, M. E. and Wann, E. G. and Yuan, R. K. and Ramos Alvarez, M.

article,Wang2021COBS,"Curiosity is a desire for information that is not motivated by strategic concerns. Latent learning is not driven by standard reinforcement processes. We propose that curiosity serves the purpose of motivating latent learning. While latent learning is often treated as a passive or incidental process, it normally reflects a strong evolved pressure to actively seek large amounts of information. That information in turn allows curious decision makers to represent the structure of their environment, that is, to form cognitive maps. These cognitive maps then drive adaptive flexible behavior. Based on recent data, we propose that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) play complementary roles in curiosity-driven learning. Specifically, we propose that (1) OFC tracks intrinsic value of information and incorporates new information into a cognitive map; and (2) dACC tracks the environmental demands and information availability to then use the cognitive map from OFC to guide behavior.",,,,,,,,,"Wang, Maya Zhe and Hayden, Benjamin Y",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-15 16:05:32 +0100,2021-01-15 16:06:08 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2020.06.003,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-1546,,,Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1 - 7,,,,,,,,,,,,"Latent learning, cognitive maps, and curiosity",,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300917,38,2021,
article,Wang2020S,"Adaptive behavior requires the ability to analyze experience both prospectively and retrospectively. How can forward-ordered neural activity facilitate the storage or expression of reverse-ordered sequences? Wang et al. used multitetrode recordings from many individual hippocampal CA1 neurons in rats while simultaneously recording field potentials expressing theta oscillations. Spatial representation in the place cell network oscillated between forward and backward sweeps within each theta oscillation. Backward replay was associated with theta peaks, whereas forward replay was associated with theta troughs. Most cells fell into one category, but some corresponding to deep-layer neurons showed bimodular responses. Backward replay was driven by entorhinal inputs, whereas forward replay was evoked by CA3 inputs. These are important insights into the underlying basis of coding future and past experiences.Science, this issue p. 247Neural networks display the ability to transform forward-ordered activity patterns into reverse-ordered, retrospective sequences. The mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unknown. We discovered that, during active navigation, rat hippocampal CA1 place cell ensembles are inherently organized to produce independent forward- and reverse-ordered sequences within individual theta oscillations. This finding may provide a circuit-level basis for retrospective evaluation and storage during ongoing behavior. Theta phase procession arose in a minority of place cells, many of which displayed two preferred firing phases in theta oscillations and preferentially participated in reverse replay during subsequent rest. These findings reveal an unexpected aspect of theta-based hippocampal encoding and provide a biological mechanism to support the expression of reverse-ordered sequences.",,,,,,,,,"Wang, Mengni and Foster, David J. and Pfeiffer, Brad E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-15 11:16:08 +0200,2020-10-15 11:18:57 +0200,,,10.1126/science.abb4151,,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6513/247.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6513,,,247--250,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,,,Alternating sequences of future and past behavior encoded within hippocampal theta oscillations,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6513/247,370,2020,

Recently, renewed interest in the role memory plays in adaptive behavior has led to new theoretical advances and empirical findings. We review key findings, with particular emphasis on the interaction between the retrieval of individual episodic memories and deliberative action selection. These results are interpreted from the perspective of an emerging framework that casts these effects in terms of sequential inference, treating reinstatements from memory as ``samples'' of potential action outcomes. This framework naturally incorporates the simultaneous influence of multiple memory representations, implementing a form of ``product of experts'' rule for arbitrating among competing predictions about action outcomes.

These ideas, in the cognitive and behavioral domain, are linked to neurophysiological ideas about cellular consolidation concerning synaptic potentiation, particularly the relationship between protein synthesis-dependent long-term changes and shorter-lasting post-translational mechanisms. Ideas from psychology about mental schemas are considered in relation to the phenomenon of systems consolidation and, specifically, about how prior knowledge can alter the rate at which consolidation occurs.

phdthesis,Wang2020UM,"Goal-directed behavior is ubiquitous in our lives, ranging from the pursuit of happiness to simply choosing tea over coffee. The adaptive and successful execution of goal-directed behavior relies on the use of cognitive maps, the mental models of the environments we interact with. Numerous studies have demonstrated the representation of cognitive maps in both hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, how goal information is learned, represented, and used, in coordination with the cognitive maps, to guide behavior, remained largely unknown. We hypothesized that goal simulation interacts with the representation of cognitive map to fulfill this function. This program of research uses reward-based decision making and 3D virtual reality foraging tasks in rhesus monkeys, with electrophysiology recording and anatomical approaches, to address this question and test our goal simulation hypothesis. We found that OFC evaluates and infers from experience to represent and update the cognitive map.

article,Watkins1992ML,"Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) is a simple way for agents to learn how to act optimally in controlled Markoviandomains. It amounts to an incremental method for dynamic programming which imposes limited computational demands. It works by successively improving its evaluations of the quality of particular actions at particular states. This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem for ~-learning based on that outlined in Watkins (1989). We show that Q-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely.

MVPA examines patterns of neural responses, rather than analyzing single voxel- or region-based values, as is customary in conventional univariate analyses. Here, we provide a practical introduction to MVPA and its most popular variants (namely, representational similarity analysis (RSA) and decoding analyses, such as classification using machine learning) for social and affective neuroscientists of all levels, particularly those new to such methods.

article,Weiskopf2006N,"Most functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies record the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using fast gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE EPI). However, GE EPI can suffer from substantial signal dropout caused by inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field. These field inhomogeneities occur near air/tissue interfaces, because they are generated by variations in magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, fMRI studies are often limited by a reduced BOLD sensitivity (BS) in inferior brain regions. Recently, a method has been developed which allows for optimizing the BS in dropout regions by specifically adjusting the slice tilt, the direction of the phase-encoding (PE), and the z-shim moment. However, optimal imaging parameters were only reported for the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and inferior temporal lobes. The present study determines the optimal slice tilt, PE direction, and z-shim moment at 3 T and 1.5 T, otherwise using standard fMRI acquisition parameters. Results are reported for all brain regions, yielding a whole-brain atlas of optimal parameters. At both field strengths, optimal parameters increase the BS by more than 60% in many voxels in the OFC and by at least 30% in the other dropout regions. BS gains are shown to be more widespread at 3 T, suggesting an increased benefit from the dropout compensation at higher fields. Even the mean BS of a large brain region, e.g., encompassing the medial OFC, can be increased by more than 15%. The maps of optimal parameters allow for assessing the feasibility and improving fMRI of brain regions affected by susceptibility-induced BS losses.",,,,,,,,,"Weiskopf, Nikolaus and Hutton, Chloe and Josephs, Oliver and Deichmann, Ralf",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-06 17:04:45 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.07.029,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,2,,,493--504,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Optimal {EPI} parameters for reduction of susceptibility-induced {BOLD} sensitivity losses: A whole-brain analysis at {3 T} and {1.5 T},,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.07.029,33,2006,

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics.

article,Wendelken2010JCN,"The capacity to reason about complex information is a central characteristic of human cognition. An important component of many reasoning tasks is the need to integrate multiple mental relations. Several researchers have argued that rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) plays a key role in relational integration. If this hypothesis is correct, then RLPFC should play a key role in transitive inference, which requires the integration of multiple relations to reach a conclusion. Thus far, however, neuroscientific research on transitive inference has focused primarily on the hippocampus. In this fMRI study, we sought to compare the roles of RLPFC and the hippocampus on a novel transitive inference paradigm. Four relations between colored balls were presented on the screen together with a target relation. Participants were asked to decide whether the target relation was correct, given the other indicated relations between balls. RLPFC, but not the hippocampus, exhibited stronger activation on trials that required relational integration as compared with trials that involved relational encoding without integration. In contrast, the hippocampus exhibited a pattern consistent with a role in relational encoding, with stronger activation on trials requiring encoding of relational predicate--argument structure as compared with trials requiring encoding of item--item associations. Functional connectivity analyses give rise to the hypothesis that RLPFC draws on hippocampal representations of mental relations during the process of relational integration.

article,Whitehead2020C,"The repeated pairing of a particular stimulus with a specific cognitive control process, such as task switching, can bind the two together in memory, resulting in the formation of stimulus-control associations. These bindings are thought to guide the context-sensitive application of cognitive control, but it is not presently known whether such stimulus-control associations are only acquired through slow, incremental learning or could also be mediated by episodic memories of a single experience, so-called one-shot learning. Here, we tested this episodic control-binding hypothesis by probing whether a single co-occurrence of a stimulus and the control process of task switching would lead to significant performance benefits (reduced task switch cost) when that stimulus later re-occurred under the same as opposed to different control demands. Across three experiments, we demonstrate that item-specific stimulus-control associations can be formed based on a single exposure, providing the first strong evidence for episodic memory guidance of cognitive control.",,,,,,,,,"Whitehead, Peter S. and Pfeuffer, Christina U. and Egner, Tobias",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-18 14:08:41 +0100,2021-01-18 14:09:02 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104220,,,,,,,,,,,,0010-0277,,,Cognition,,,"Cognitive control, Episodic memory, Learning, Attention, Task switching",,,,,,,,,,,,,,104220,,,,,,,,,,,,Memories of control: One-shot episodic learning of item-specific stimulus-control associations,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720300391,199,2020,

article,Wible1986BR,"The role of hippocampus in memory processing was examined by recording single unit activity while rats performed two different types of memory tasks. The same apparatus was used for all tasks; it consisted of two goal ☐es, side by side, on the end of a runway. One goal ☐ was white, the other was black. Experiment I used a working memory, delayed match-to-sample (DMTS) task. A trial began with a sample phase in which the rat was forced to a goal ☐ containing a reward. The rat was then placed at the beginning of the runway again for the choice phase and allowed to enter either of the two goal ☐es. Entering the goal ☐ with the same color as that entered during the sample phase was rewarded. Experiment II used a within-subjects, within-units, design to test rats in two reference memory tasks, acue task and aspatial task. During the cue task, the rat was rewarded for choosing the same colored goal ☐ on each trial regardless of its spatial location. During the spatial task, the rat was rewarded for choosing the goal ☐ in a specific location on each trial regardless of its color. During all tasks, the location of the goal ☐es was changed between trials in a pseudorandom, counterbalanced fashion so that each colored goal ☐ was on the right for half of the trials and on the left for half of the trials. During performance of the DMTS task, activity of most units was correlated with a combination of factors such as color and location, or color and phase. For example, most units showing differential activity in one of the colored goal ☐es fired more when that ☐ was in a certain spatial location, or during either the sample or choice phase. During performance of the reference memory tasks, the activity of most units was not correlated with behavior. However, the rate for some units changed between the cue and spatial tasks. When unit activity was correlated with behavior, it was dependent on a combination of dimensions such as color and spatial location. These results demonstrate that units in the hippocampus respond to combinations of stimulus dimensions such as color and spatial location, and to the temporal context necessary to solve a working memory task.",,,,,,,,,"Wible, Cynthia G. and Findling, Robert L. and Shapiro, Matthew and Lang, Eric J. and Crane, Sharon and Olton, David S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-14 16:21:51 +0100,2021-01-14 16:22:07 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(86)90604-9,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8993,,,Brain Research,,,"Memory, Single unit recording, Hippocampus, Working memory, Reference memory, Delayed match-to-sample",,,,,,,,,,,1,,,97 - 110,,,,,,,,,,,,Mnemonic correlates of unit activity in the hippocampus,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006899386906049,399,1986,

article,Wiener1989JN,"The firing rate of hippocampal neurons in rats was related both to spatial location and to multiple behavioral variables as rats performed 2 kinds of tasks that rely on hippocampal function: a spatial navigation task similar in performance demands to the radial-arm maze task and a simultaneous cue odor-discrimination task. In the place task, most cells had distinct single or multiple place fields, that is, neurons increased firing when the rat was in a particular location or locations. However, in most of these cells, firing rate also varied systematically in relation to behavioral variables, including the speed, direction, and turning angle of the rat as it moved through the place field. In addition, the activity of most cells was time-locked to task-relevant approach movements. In the odor task, most cells fired as the rat sampled discriminative cues or when it executed specific, task- relevant approach movements. Some cells fired selectively in relation to which odors were presented, the configuration of odor cues, the locus of the response, or a combination of these variables. Many cells with spatial correlates in the place task also had striking behavioral correlates when rats performed the odor task in the same environment, and the locus of the increased firing associated with behavior in the odor task was not the same as the place field in the place task. Thus, while the complex stimuli that compose spatial cues are reflected in hippocampal neuronal activity, hippocampal processing is not limited to the representation of spatial location. Rather, the domain of hippocampal representation includes both spatial and nonspatial relations among multiple cues and the actions directed in relation to these cues, across cue modalities, and across behavioral paradigms.",,,,,,,,,"Wiener, SI and Paul, CA and Eichenbaum, H",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-14 17:42:01 +0100,2021-01-14 17:42:27 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.09-08-02737.1989,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/9/8/2737.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,2737--2763,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Spatial and behavioral correlates of hippocampal neuronal activity,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/9/8/2737,9,1989,
article,Wierzynski2009N,"Cortico-hippocampal interactions during sleep are believed to reorganize neural circuits in support of memory consolidation. However, spike-timing relationships across cortico-hippocampal networks---key determinants of synaptic changes---are poorly understood. Here we show that cells in prefrontal cortex fire consistently within 100 ms after hippocampal cells in naturally sleeping animals. This provides evidence at the single cell-pair level for highly consistent directional interactions between these areas within the window of plasticity. Moreover, these interactions are state dependent: they are driven by hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR) bursts in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and are sharply reduced during REM sleep. Finally, prefrontal responses are nonlinear: as the strength of hippocampal bursts rises, short-latency prefrontal responses are augmented by increased spindle band activity and a secondary peak ∼100 ms later. These findings suggest that SWR events are atomic units of hippocampal-prefrontal communication during SWS and that the coupling between these areas is highly attenuated during REM sleep.",,,,,,,,,"Wierzynski, Casimir M. and Lubenov, Evgueniy V. and Gu, Ming and Siapas, Athanassios G.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-27 12:19:22 +0100,2020-11-27 12:19:46 +0100,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.011,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,"SYSNEURO, SIGNALING, SYSBIO",,,,,,,,,,,4,,,587 - 596,,,,,,,,,,,,State-Dependent Spike-Timing Relationships between Hippocampal and Prefrontal Circuits during Sleep,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309000786,61,2009,
article,Wikenheiser2017N,"The hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) both make important contributions to decision making and other cognitive processes. However, despite anatomical links between the two, few studies have tested the importance of hippocampal--OFC interactions. Here, we recorded OFC neurons in rats performing a decision making task while suppressing activity in a key hippocampal output region, the ventral subiculum. OFC neurons encoded information about expected outcomes and rats' responses. With hippocampal output suppressed, rats were slower to adapt to changes in reward contingency, and OFC encoding of response information was strongly attenuated. In addition, ventral subiculum inactivation prevented OFC neurons from integrating information about features of outcomes to form holistic representations of the outcomes available in specific trial blocks. These data suggest that the hippocampus contributes to OFC encoding of both concrete, low-level features of expected outcomes, and abstract, inferred properties of the structure of the world, such as task state. {\copyright} 2017",,,,"NIDA Intramural Research Program, Cellular Neurobiology Research Branch, Behavioral Neurophysiology Research Section, Baltimore, MD 21224, United States; Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Maryland, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, United States; Solomon H.

The discovery of place cells in the rodent hippocampus immediately suggested a plausible neural mechanism to fulfill the `map' component of Tolman's theory. Recent work examining hippocampal representations occurring at fast time scales suggests that these sequences might be important for supporting the inferential mental operations associated with the cognitive map function.

Theta sequences represent time-compressed trajectories through space. Their forward-directed nature makes them an intuitive candidate mechanism for planning future trajectories, but their connection to goal-directed behavior remains unclear. As rats performed a value-guided decision-making task, the extent to which theta sequences projected ahead of the animal's current location varied on a moment-by-moment basis depending on the rat's goals. Look-ahead extended farther on journeys to distant goals than on journeys to more proximal goals and was predictive of the animal's destination. On arrival at goals, however, look-ahead was similar regardless of where the animal began its journey from.

In a novel space, the ensemble code was initially less robust but improved rapidly with exploration.

Cells that were inactive during behavior, or that were active but had non-overlapping spatial firing, did not show this increase.

Two endogenous lipids, anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), have been identified as CB1 ligands5,6. Depolarized hippocampal neurons rapidly release both anandamide and 2-AG in a Ca2+-dependent manner6,7,8. In the hippocampus, CB1 is expressed mainly by GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibitory interneurons, where CB1 clusters on the axon terminal9,10,11. A synthetic CB1 agonist depresses GABA release from hippocampal slices10,12. These findings indicate that the function of endogenous cannabinoids released by depolarized hippocampal neurons might be to downregulate GABA release. Here we show that the transient suppression of GABA-mediated transmission that follows depolarization of hippocampal pyramidal neurons13 is mediated by retrograde signalling through release of endogenous cannabinoids.

Here we provide a biased and incomplete snapshot of this field focusing on the major finding that many organisms use two distinct strategies to solve the explore-exploit dilemma: a bias for information (`directed exploration') and the randomization of choice (`random exploration').

To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online.

Here, we propose a unifying theory of OFC function. We hypothesize that OFC provides an abstraction of currently available information in the form of a labeling of the current task state, which is used for reinforcement learning (RL) elsewhere in the brain. This function is especially critical when task states include unobservable information, for instance, from working memory. We use this framework to explain classic findings in reversal learning, delayed alternation, extinction, and devaluation as well as more recent findings showing the effect of OFC lesions on the firing of dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) in rodents performing an RL task.

article,Wilson2018P,"Successful demonstrations of novel short-cut taking by animals, including humans, are open to interpretation in terms of learning that is not necessarily spatial. A classic example is that of Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish (1946) who allowed rats to repeat a sequence of turns through the corridors of a maze to locate a food reward. When the entrance to the corridors was subsequently blocked and alternative corridors were made available, rats successfully selected the corridor leading most directly to the food location. However, the presence of a distinctive light above the goal, in both the training and testing phases, means that approach to the light as a beacon could have been the source of successful short-cutting. We report a replication of the experimental design of Tolman et al. with human participants who explored geometrically equivalent virtual environments. An experimental group, who followed the original procedure in the absence of any distinctive cues proximal to the goal, did not select the corridor which led most directly to the goal. A control group, who experienced a light above the goal during training and testing, were more likely to select a corridor which led in the direction of the goal. A second control group experienced the light above the goal during training, but in the test the location of this cue was shifted by 90$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the start point of exploration. This latter group responded unsystematically in the test, neither selecting a corridor leading to the original goal location, nor one leading directly to the relocated light cue. The results do not support the hypothesis that travelling a multi-path route automatically leads to an integrated cognitive representation of that route. The data offer support for the importance of local cues which can serve as beacons to indicate the location of a goal.",,,,,,,,,"Wilson, Stuart P. and Wilson, Paul N.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-22 12:22:26 +0100,2020-12-22 12:22:42 +0100,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0208794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,12,,,1-15,,,,Public Library of Science,,,,,,,,Failure to demonstrate short-cutting in a replication and extension of Tolman et al.'s spatial learning experiment with humans,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208794,13,2018,
article,Wimber2012CB,"Episodic memory refers to humans' unique ability to mentally reconstruct past events. Neurocomputational models predict that remembering entails the reinstatement of brain activity that was present when an event was initially experienced [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], a claim that has recently gained support from functional imaging work in humans [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The nature of this reactivation, however, is still unclear. Cognitive models claim that retrieval is set off by an early reactivation of stored memory representations (``ecphory'') [15, 16, 17]. However, reinstatement as found in imaging studies might also reflect postretrieval processes that operate on the products of retrieval and are thus a consequence rather than a precondition of remembering. Here, we used frequency entrainment as a novel method of tagging memories in the human electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants studied words presented on flickering backgrounds, entraining a steady-state brain response at either 6 or 10 Hz. We found that these frequency signatures rapidly reemerged during a later memory test when participants successfully recognized a word.

article,Wimmer2014JN,"Learning is essential for adaptive decision making. The striatum and its dopaminergic inputs are known to support incremental reward-based learning, while the hippocampus is known to support encoding of single events (episodic memory). Although traditionally studied separately, in even simple experiences, these two types of learning are likely to co-occur and may interact. Here we sought to understand the nature of this interaction by examining how incremental reward learning is related to concurrent episodic memory encoding. During the experiment, human participants made choices between two options (colored squares), each associated with a drifting probability of reward, with the goal of earning as much money as possible. Incidental, trial-unique object pictures, unrelated to the choice, were overlaid on each option. The next day, participants were given a surprise memory test for these pictures. We found that better episodic memory was related to a decreased influence of recent reward experience on choice, both within and across participants. fMRI analyses further revealed that during learning the canonical striatal reward prediction error signal was significantly weaker when episodic memory was stronger. This decrease in reward prediction error signals in the striatum was associated with enhanced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and striatum at the time of choice.

While decades of neuroscience research have shown how reinforcement gradually shapes preferences, decisions are often influenced by single past experiences. Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the influence of single learning episodes. Although recent work has proposed a role for episodes in decision making, it is largely unknown whether and how episodic experiences contribute to value-based decision making and how the values of single episodes are represented in the brain. In multiple behavioral experiments and an fMRI experiment, we tested whether and how rewarding episodes could support later decision making. Participants experienced episodes of high reward or low reward in conjunction with incidental, trial-unique neutral pictures. In a surprise test phase, we found that participants could indeed remember the associated level of reward, as evidenced by accurate source memory for value and preferences to re-engage with rewarded objects. Further, in a separate experiment, we found that high-reward objects shown as primes before a gambling task increased financial risk taking. Neurally, re-exposure to objects in the test phase led to significant reactivation of reward-related patterns. Importantly, individual variability in the strength of reactivation predicted value memory performance. Our results provide a novel demonstration that affect-related neural patterns are reactivated during later experience.

article,Wimmer2020aB,"Over the past few decades, neuroscience research has illuminated the neural mechanisms supporting learning from reward feedback, demonstrating a critical role for the striatum and ascending midbrain dopamine system. However, in humans, short-term working memory can also play an important role in reward-based learning, particularly in common paradigms that are relatively compressed in time. Given the growing use of reward-based learning tasks in translational studies in computational psychiatry, it is important to further investigate the degree to which apparent reinforcement learning is driven by working memory contributions. In our experiments, we manipulated the spacing between repetitions and also the post-learning delay period duration. Supporting a significant role for working memory in reward-based learning, we found that learning was faster for massed-trained compared to spaced-trained stimuli, and that brief interruptions of massed learning led to drops in subsequent performance. Further, individual differences in working memory capacity positively correlated with massed learning performance. Critically, after a delay period but not immediately, relative performance decayed in the massed condition and increased in the spaced condition. Overall, our results provide further support that working memory plays a large role in temporally condensed reward learning designs.

article,Wimmer2012S,"So-called irrational decisions made by humans are popular fodder for {\textquotedblleft}believe it or not{\textquotedblright} stories. But what{\textquoteright}s actually happening when we make choices that do not seem to be justifiable on purely economic or logical grounds? Presumably, we are not simply making errors; instead, our choices may reflect an internal bias that we are not aware of. Wimmer and Shohamy (p. 270) show how the hippocampus can instill an unconscious bias in valuations, whereby an object that is not highly valued on its own, increases in value when it becomes implicitly associated with a truly high-value object. As a consequence, we then end up preferring the associated object over a neutral object of equal objective value while not really knowing why.Every day people make new choices between alternatives that they have never directly experienced. Yet, such decisions are often made rapidly and confidently. Here, we show that the hippocampus, traditionally known for its role in building long-term declarative memories, enables the spread of value across memories, thereby guiding decisions between new choice options. Using functional brain imaging in humans, we discovered that giving people monetary rewards led to activation of a preestablished network of memories, spreading the positive value of reward to nonrewarded items stored in memory. Later, people were biased to choose these nonrewarded items. This decision bias was predicted by activity in the hippocampus, reactivation of associated memories, and connectivity between memory and reward regions in the brain. These findings explain how choices among new alternatives emerge automatically from the associative mechanisms by which the brain builds memories.

article,Winocur2011JINS,"With time and experience, memories undergo a process of reorganization that involves different neuronal networks, known as systems consolidation. The traditional view, as articulated in standard consolidation theory (SCT), is that (episodic and semantic) memories initially depend on the hippocampus, but eventually become consolidated in their original forms in other brain regions. In this study, we review the main principles of SCT and report evidence from the neuropsychological literature that would not be predicted by this theory. By comparison, the evidence supports an alternative account, the transformation hypothesis, whose central premise is that changes in neural representation in systems consolidation are accompanied by corresponding changes in the nature of the memory. According to this view, hippocampally dependent, episodic, or context-specific memories transform into semantic or gist-like versions that are represented in extra-hippocampal structures. To the extent that episodic memories are retained, they will continue to require the hippocampus, but the hippocampus is not needed for the retrieval of semantic memories.

To study how hippocampal neurons convey information about reward and trial outcome during new associative learning, we recorded hippocampal neurons as monkeys learned novel object-place associations. A large population of hippocampal neurons (50%) signaled trial outcome by differentiating between correct and error trials during the period after the behavioral response. About half these cells increased their activity following correct trials (correct up cells) while the remaining half fired more following error trials (error up cells). Moreover, correct up cells, but not error up cells, conveyed information about learning by increasing their stimulus-selective response properties with behavioral learning.

article,Wise2020B,"Harm avoidance is critical for survival, yet little is known regarding the underlying neural mechanisms supporting avoidance when we cannot rely on direct trial and error experience. Neural reactivation, and sequential replay, have emerged as potential candidate mechanisms. Here, during an aversive learning task, in conjunction with magnetoencephalography, we show prospective and retrospective reactivation for planning and learning respectively, coupled to evidence for sequential replay. Specifically, when subjects plan in an aversive context, we find preferential reactivation of subsequently chosen goal states and sequential replay of the preceding path. This reactivation was associated with greater hippocampal theta power. At outcome receipt, unchosen goal states are reactivated regardless of outcome valence. However, replay of paths leading to goal states was directionally modulated by outcome valence, with aversive outcomes leading to stronger reverse replay compared to safe outcomes. Our findings suggest that avoidance behaviour involves simulation of alternative future and past outcome states through hippocampally-mediated reactivation and replay.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Wise, Toby and Liu, Yunzhe and Chowdhury, Fatima and Dolan, Raymond J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 11:38:00 +0100,2021-01-07 17:29:36 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.11.30.404491,,,,,2020.11.30.404491,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/02/2020.11.30.404491.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Model-based aversive learning in humans is supported by preferential task state reactivation,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/12/02/2020.11.30.404491,,2020,
article,Wiskott2002NC,"Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition.

article,Wittkuhn2018N,"Adaptive behavior in daily life often requires the ability to acquire and represent sequential contingencies between actions and the associated outcomes. Although accumulating evidence implicates the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in complex value-based learning and decision-making, direct evidence for involvements of this region in integrating information across sequential decision states is still scarce. Using a 3-stage deterministic Markov decision task, here we applied offline, inhibitory low-frequency 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dlPFC in young male adults (n = 31, mean age = 23.8 years, SD = 2.5 years) in a within-subject cross-over design to study the roles of this region in influencing value-based sequential decision-making. In two separate sessions, each participant received 1-Hz rTMS stimulation either over the left dlPFC or over the vertex. The results showed that transiently inhibiting the left dlPFC impaired choice accuracy, particularly in situations in which the acquisition of sequential transitions between decision states and temporally lagged action-outcome contingencies played a greater role. Estimating parameters of a diffusion model from behavioral choices, we found that the diffusion drift rate, which reflects the efficiency of information integration, was attenuated by the stimulation. Moreover, the effects of rTMS interacted with session: individuals who could not efficiently integrate information across sequential states in the first session due to disrupted dlPFC function also could not catch up in performance during the second session with those individuals who could learn sequential transitions with intact dlPFC function in the first session. Taken together, our findings suggest that the left dlPFC is crucially involved in the acquisition of complex sequential relations and in the potential of such learning.",,,,,,,,,"Wittkuhn, Lennart and Eppinger, Ben and Bartsch, Lea M. and Thurm, Franka and Korb, Franziska M. and Li, Shu-Chen",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-16 19:12:27 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.057,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,,,,384--395,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex modulates value-based learning during sequential decision-making,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.057,167,2018,
article,Wittkuhn2020B,"Neural computations are often anatomically localized and executed on sub-second time scales. Understanding the brain therefore requires methods that offer sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. This poses a particular challenge for the study of the human brain because non-invasive methods have either high temporal or spatial resolution, but not both. Here, we introduce a novel multivariate analysis method for conventional blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) that allows to study sequentially activated neural patterns separated by less than 100 ms with anatomical precision. Human participants underwent fMRI and were presented with sequences of visual stimuli separated by 32 to 2048 ms. Probabilistic pattern classifiers were trained on fMRI data to detect the presence of image-specific activation patterns in early visual and ventral temporal cortex. The classifiers were then applied to data recorded during sequences of the same images presented at increasing speeds. Our results show that probabilistic classifier time courses allowed to detect neural representations and their order, even when images were separated by only 32 ms. Moreover, the frequency spectrum of the statistical sequentiality metric distinguished between sequence speeds on sub-second versus supra-second time scales. These results survived when data with high levels of noise and rare sequence events at unknown times were analyzed.

article,Wolosin2012JCN,"Emerging evidence suggests that motivation enhances episodic memory formation through interactions between medial-temporal lobe (MTL) structures and dopaminergic midbrain. In addition, recent theories propose that motivation specifically facilitates hippocampal associative binding processes, resulting in more detailed memories that are readily reinstated from partial input. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to determine how motivation influences associative encoding and retrieval processes within human MTL subregions and dopaminergic midbrain. Participants intentionally encoded object associations under varying conditions of reward and performed a retrieval task during which studied associations were cued from partial input. Behaviorally, cued recall performance was superior for high-value relative to low-value associations; however, participants differed in the degree to which rewards influenced memory. The magnitude of behavioral reward modulation was associated with reward-related activation changes in dentate gyrus/CA2,3 during encoding and enhanced functional connectivity between dentate gyrus/CA2,3 and dopaminergic midbrain during both the encoding and retrieval phases of the task. These findings suggests that, within the hippocampus, reward-based motivation specifically enhances dentate gyrus/CA2,3 associative encoding mechanisms through interactions with dopaminergic midbrain. Furthermore, within parahippocampal cortex and dopaminergic midbrain regions, activation associated with successful memory formation was modulated by reward across the group. During the retrieval phase, we also observed enhanced activation in hippocampus and dopaminergic midbrain for high-value associations that occurred in the absence of any explicit cues to reward. Collectively, these findings shed light on fundamental mechanisms through which reward impacts associative memory formation and retrieval through facilitation of MTL and ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra processing.",,,,,,doi: 10.1162/jocn{\_}a{\_}00237,,,"Wolosin, Sasha M. and Zeithamova, Dagmar and Preston, Alison R.",,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,,,,,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,,,,,,2020-12-11 14:49:54 +0100,2020-12-11 14:51:22 +0100,,,10.1162/jocn{\_}a{\_}00237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,2020/12/11,,,7,,,1532--1547,,,,MIT Press,,,,,,,,Reward Modulation of Hippocampal Subfield Activation during Successful Associative Encoding and Retrieval,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00237,24,2012,

Here we show that this integration occurs `online' during stage 2: when activity in the region that consolidated the sound-light memory (perirhinal cortex) was inhibited during formation of the light-danger memory, rats no longer showed fear when tested with the sound but continued to fear the light.

In contrast, there has been controversy over whether the hippocampus mediates a similarly general memory function in other species, or whether it is dedicated to spatial memory processing3,4,5,6. Evidence for the spatial view is derived principally from the observations of `place cells'---hippocampal neurons that fire whenever the animal is in a particular location in its environment7,8, or when it perceives a specific stimulus or performs a specific behaviour in a particular place3,4. We trained rats to perform the same recognition memory task in several distinct locations in a rich spatial environment and found that the activity of many hippocampal neurons was related consistently to perceptual, behavioural or cognitive events, regardless of the location where these events occurred.

article,Wu2020B,"There is a resurgence of interest in ""cognitive maps"" based on recent evidence that the hippocampal-entorhinal system encodes both spatial and non-spatial information, with far-reaching implications for human behavior. Yet little is known about the commonalities and differences in the computational principles underlying human learning and decision making in spatial and non-spatial domains. We use a within-subject design to examine how humans search for either spatially or conceptually correlated rewards. Using a Bayesian learning model, we find evidence for the same computational mechanisms of generalization across domains.

article,Wu2020PCB,"Learning and generalization in spatial domains is often thought to rely on a ``cognitive map'', representing relationships between spatial locations. Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more abstract, conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains.

This reactivation occurred in ripple-associated awake replay of place cell sequences encoding the paths from the animal's current positions to the shock zone but not in place cell sequences within individual cycles of theta oscillation.

article,Wu2014JN,"Hippocampal place-cell replay has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory, which might support navigational learning and planning. An important hypothesis of relevance to these proposed functions is that the information encoded in replay should reflect the topological structure of experienced environments; that is, which places in the environment are connected with which others. Here we report several attributes of replay observed in rats exploring a novel forked environment that support the hypothesis. First, we observed that overlapping replays depicting divergent trajectories through the fork recruited the same population of cells with the same firing rates to represent the common portion of the trajectories. Second, replay tended to be directional and to flip the represented direction at the fork. Third, replay-associated sharp-wave{\textendash}ripple events in the local field potential exhibited substructure that mapped onto the maze topology. Thus, the spatial complexity of our recording environment was accurately captured by replay: the underlying neuronal activities reflected the bifurcating shape, and both directionality and associated ripple structure reflected the segmentation of the maze. Finally, we observed that replays occurred rapidly after small numbers of experiences.

article,Xia2020B,"Humans use prior knowledge to efficiently solve novel tasks, but how they structure past knowledge to enable such fast generalization is not well understood. We recently proposed that hierarchical state abstraction enabled generalization of simple one-step rules, by inferring context clusters for each rule. However, humans' daily tasks are often temporally extended, and necessitate more complex multi-step, hierarchically structured strategies. The options framework in hierarchical reinforcement learning provides a theoretical framework for representing such transferable strategies. Options are abstract multi-step policies, assembled from simpler one-step actions or other options, that can represent meaningful reusable strategies as temporal abstractions. We developed a novel sequential decision making protocol to test if humans learn and transfer multi-step options. In a series of four experiments, we found transfer effects at multiple hierarchical levels of abstraction that could not be explained by flat reinforcement learning models or hierarchical models lacking temporal abstraction. We extended the options framework to develop a quantitative model that blends temporal and state abstractions. Our model captures the transfer effects observed in human participants. Our results provide evidence that humans create and compose hierarchical options, and use them to explore in novel contexts, consequently transferring past knowledge and speeding up learning.",,,,,,,,,"Xia, Liyu and Collins, Anne G.

article,Xing2013JN,"Most studies of the early stages of visual analysis (V1-V3) have focused on the properties of neurons that support processing of elemental features of a visual stimulus or scene, such as local contrast, orientation, or direction of motion. Recent evidence from electrophysiology and neuroimaging studies, however, suggests that early visual cortex may also play a role in retaining stimulus representations in memory for short periods. For example, fMRI responses obtained during the delay period between two presentations of an oriented visual stimulus can be used to decode the remembered stimulus orientation with multivariate pattern analysis. Here, we investigated whether orientation is a special case or if this phenomenon generalizes to working memory traces of other visual features. We found that multivariate classification of fMRI signals from human visual cortex could be used to decode the contrast of a perceived stimulus even when the mean response changes were accounted for, suggesting some consistent spatial signal for contrast in these areas. Strikingly, we found that fMRI responses also supported decoding of contrast when the stimulus had to be remembered. Furthermore, classification generalized from perceived to remembered stimuli and vice versa, implying that the corresponding pattern of responses in early visual cortex were highly consistent. In additional analyses, we show that stimulus decoding here is driven by biases depending on stimulus eccentricity. This places important constraints on the interpretation for decoding stimulus properties for which cortical processing is known to vary with eccentricity, such as contrast, color, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency.",,,,,,,,,"Xing, Y. and Ledgeway, T. and McGraw, P.

Here, using a radial eight-arm maze, we examined how the combined demand on these memories influenced CA1 place cell assemblies while reference memories were partially updated. This was contrasted with control tasks requiring only working memory or the update of reference memory. Reference memory update led to the reward-directed place field shifts at newly rewarded arms and to the gradual strengthening of firing in passes between newly rewarded arms but not between those passes that included a familiar-rewarded arm. At the maze center, transient network synchronization periods preferentially replayed trajectories of the next chosen arm in reference memory tasks but the previously visited arm in the working memory task.

Similar sleep cycles were evident in both M1 and cerebellum as cyclical fluctuations in firing rates as well as a reciprocal pattern of slow waves and sleep spindles. Directed connectivity from motor cortex to the cerebellum suggested a neocortical origin of slow waves. Surprisingly however, spindles were associated with a directional influence from the cerebellum to motor cortex, conducted via the thalamus. Furthermore, the relative phase of spindle-band oscillations in the neocortex and cerebellum varied systematically with their changing amplitudes. We used linear dynamical systems analysis to show that this behaviour could only be explained by a system of two coupled oscillators. These observations appear inconsistent with a single spindle generator within the thalamo-cortical system, and suggest instead a cerebellar contribution to neocortical sleep spindles.

article,Xu2019JN,"Sequential firing of neurons during sleep is thought to play a role in the consolidation of learning. However, direct evidence for such sequence replay is limited to only a few brain areas and sleep states mainly in rodents. Using a custom-designed wearable neural data logger and chronically implanted electrodes, we made long-term recordings of neural activity in the primary motor cortex of two female nonhuman primates during free behavior and natural sleep. We used the local field potential (LFP) spectrogram to characterize sleep cycles, and examined firing rates, correlations, and sequential firing of neurons at different frequency bands through the cycle. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) was characterized by low neural firing rates and high synchrony, reflecting slow oscillations between cortical down and up states. However, the order in which neurons entered up states was similar to the sequence of neural activity observed at low frequencies during waking behavior. In addition, we found evidence of brief bursts of theta oscillation, associated with non-SWS states, during which neurons fired in strikingly regular sequential order phase-locked to the LFP. Theta sequences were preserved between waking and sleep, but appeared not to resemble the order of neural activity observed at lower frequencies. The sequential firing of neurons during slow oscillations and theta bursts may contribute to the consolidation of procedural memories during sleep.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Replay of sequential neural activity during sleep is believed to support consolidation of daytime learning. Despite a wealth of studies investigating sequential replay in association with episodic and spatial memory, it is unknown whether similar sequences occur in motor areas during sleep. Within long-term neural recordings from monkey motor cortex, we found two distinct patterns of sequential activity during different phases of the natural sleep cycle. Slow-wave sleep was associated with delta-band sequences that resembled low-frequency activity during movement, while occasional brief bursts of theta oscillation were associated with a different order of sequential firing. Our results are the first report of sequential sleep replay in the motor cortex, which may play an important role in consolidation of procedural learning.",,,,,,,,,"Xu, Wei and de Carvalho, Felipe and Jackson, Andrew",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-15 17:27:35 +0100,2020-12-15 17:27:59 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1408-18.2019,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/19/3698.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,,,3698--3712,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Sequential Neural Activity in Primary Motor Cortex during Sleep,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/19/3698,39,2019,

However, the temporal dynamics of reinstatement in the human cortex remain poorly understood. One possibility is that neural activity during memory retrieval, like replay of spiking neurons in the hippocampus, occurs at a faster timescale than during encoding. We tested this hypothesis in 34 participants who performed a verbal episodic memory task while we recorded high gamma (62--100 Hz) activity from subdural electrodes implanted for seizure monitoring. We show that reinstatement of distributed patterns of high gamma activity occurs faster than during encoding. Using a time-warping algorithm, we quantify the timescale of the reinstatement and identify brain regions that show significant timescale differences between encoding and retrieval.

Chains of ripples (ripple bursts) in CA1 have been reported to co-occur with long-range place cell sequence replays during the quiet awake state, but roles of neural inputs to CA1 in ripple bursts and replays are unknown. Here we show that ripple bursts in CA1 and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are temporally associated. An inhibition of MECIII input to CA1 during quiet awake reduced ripple bursts in CA1 and restricted the spatial coverage of replays to a shorter distance corresponding to single ripple events. The reduction did not occur with MECIII input inhibition during slow-wave sleep. Inhibition of CA3 activity suppressed ripples and replays in CA1 regardless of behavioral state.

article,Yarkoni2019P,"Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned---that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the ""random effects"" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.",,,,,,,,,"Yarkoni, Tal",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAaLi4vcGFwZXJzL3lhcmtvbmkyMDE5cC5wZGZPEQFsAAAAAAFsAAIAAAVtYWNPUwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQkQAAf////8QeWFya29uaTIwMTlwLnBkZgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIAAAogY3UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABnBhcGVycwACAD8vOlVzZXJzOndpdHRrdWhuOkRvY3VtZW50czpiaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6cGFwZXJzOnlhcmtvbmkyMDE5cC5wZGYAAA4AIgAQAHkAYQByAGsAbwBuAGkAMgAwADEAOQBwAC4AcABkAGYADwAMAAUAbQBhAGMATwBTABIAPVVzZXJzL3dpdHRrdWhuL0RvY3VtZW50cy9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvcGFwZXJzL3lhcmtvbmkyMDE5cC5wZGYAABMAAS8AABUAAgAP//8AAAAIAA0AGgAkAEEAAAAAAAACAQAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABsQ==,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-22 07:58:16 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.31234/osf.io/jqw35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,,,,,,,,Center for Open Science,,,,,,,,The Generalizability Crisis,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jqw35,,2019,

article,Ylinen1995JN,"Sharp wave bursts, induced by a cooperative discharge of CA3 pyramidal cells, are the most synchronous physiological pattern in the hippocampus. In conjunction with sharp wave bursts, CA1 pyramidal cells display a high-frequency (200 Hz) network oscillation (ripple). In the present study extracellular field and unit activity was recorded simultaneously from 16 closely spaces sites in the awake rat and the intracellular activity of CA1 pyramidal cells during the network oscillation was studied under anesthesia. Current source density analysis of the high-frequency oscillation revealed circumscribed sinks and sources in the vicinity of the pyramidal layer. Single pyramidal cells discharged at a low frequency but were phase locked to the negative peak of the locally derived field oscillation. Approximately 10% of the simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells fired during a given oscillatory event. Putative interneurons increased their discharge rates during the field ripples severalfold and often maintained a 200 Hz frequency during the oscillatory event. Under urethane and ketamine anesthesia the frequency of ripples was slower (100--120 Hz) than in the awake rat (180--200 Hz). Halothane anesthesia prevented the occurrence of high-frequency field oscillations in the CA1 region. Both the amplitude (1--4 mV) and phase of the intracellular ripple, but not its frequency, were voltage dependent. The amplitude of intracellular ripple was smallest between -70 and -80 mV. The phase of intracellular oscillation relative to the extracellular ripple reversed when the membrane was hyperpolarized more than -80 mV. A histologically verified CA1 basket cell increased its firing rate during the network oscillation and discharged at the frequency of the extracellular ripple. These findings indicate that the intracellularly recorded fast oscillatory rhythm is not solely dependent on membrane currents intrinsic to the CA1 pyramidal cells but it is a network driven phenomenon dependent upon the participation of inhibitory interneurons. We hypothesize that fast field oscillation (200 Hz) in the CA1 region reflects summed IPSPs in pyramidal cells as a result of high-frequency barrage of interneurons. The sharp wave associated synchronous discharge of pyramidal cells in the millisecond range can exert a powerful influence on retrohippocampal targets and may facilitate the transfer of transiently stored memory traces from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex.",,,,,,,,,"Ylinen, A and Bragin, A and Nadasdy, Z and Jando, G and Szabo, I and Sik, A and Buzs{\'a}ki, Gy{\""o}rgy",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-19 15:43:10 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1523/jneurosci.15-01-00030.1995,,,,,,,,,,,,1529-2401,,,The Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,Jan,,,1,,,30--46,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,ripples; replay; hippocampus,,Sharp wave-associated high-frequency oscillation (200 Hz) in the intact hippocampus: network and intracellular mechanisms,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.15-01-00030.1995,15,1995,
article,Yu2017E,"While ongoing experience proceeds continuously, memories of past experience are often recalled as episodes with defined beginnings and ends. The neural mechanisms that lead to the formation of discrete episodes from the stream of neural activity patterns representing ongoing experience are unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we recorded neural activity in the rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, structures critical for memory processes. We show that during spatial navigation, hippocampal CA1 place cells maintain a continuous spatial representation across different states of motion (movement and immobility). In contrast, during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), when representations of experience are transiently reactivated from memory, movement- and immobility-associated activity patterns are most often reactivated separately. Concurrently, distinct hippocampal reactivations of movement- or immobility-associated representations are accompanied by distinct modulation patterns in prefrontal cortex.

article,Yu2015NLM,"When making a decision it is often necessary to consider the available alternatives in order to choose the most appropriate option. This deliberative process, where the pros and cons of each option are considered, relies on memories of past actions and outcomes. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are required for memory encoding, memory retrieval and decision making, but it is unclear how these areas support deliberation. Here we examine the potential neural substrates of these processes in the rat. The rat is a powerful model to investigate the network mechanisms underlying deliberation in the mammalian brain given the anatomical and functional conservation of its hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to other mammalian systems. Importantly, it is amenable to large scale neural recording while performing laboratory tasks that exploit its natural decision-making behavior.

Sparse spiking outside of the receptive field is often considered to be noise, rather than a reflection of information processing. Whether this characterization is accurate remains unclear. We therefore contrasted the sparse, temporally isolated spiking of hippocampal CA1 place cells to the consistent, temporally adjacent spiking seen within their spatial receptive fields ({\textquotedblleft}place fields{\textquotedblright}). We found that isolated spikes, which occur during locomotion, are more strongly phase coupled to hippocampal theta oscillations than adjacent spikes and, surprisingly, transiently express coherent representations of non-local spatial representations. Further, prefrontal cortical activity is coordinated with, and can predict the occurrence of future isolated spiking events. Rather than local noise within the hippocampus, sparse, isolated place cell spiking reflects a coordinated cortical-hippocampal process consistent with the generation of non-local scenario representations during active navigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Yu, Jai Y. and Frank, Loren M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-12-14 09:23:24 +0100,2020-12-14 09:23:46 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.11.23.395012,,,,,2020.11.23.395012,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/24/2020.11.23.395012.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Prefrontal cortical activity predicts the extra-place field spiking of hippocampal place cells,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/24/2020.11.23.395012,,2020,

article,Zalesak2009PRN,"Transitive inference (TI) is the ability to infer the relationship between items (e.g., A>C) after having learned a set of premise pairs (e.g., A>B and B>C). Previous studies in humans have identified a distributed neural network, including cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, during TI judgments. We studied two aspects of TI using functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects who had acquired the six-item sequence (A>B>C>D>E>F) of visual stimuli. First, the identification of novel pairs not containing end items (i.e., B>D, C>E, B>E) was associated with greater left hippocampal activation compared with the identification of novel pairs containing end items A and F. This demonstrates that the identification of stimulus pairs requiring the flexible representation of a sequence is associated with hippocampal activation. Second, for the three novel pairs devoid of end items we found greater right hippocampal activation for pairs B>D and C>E compared with pair B>E. This indicates that TI decisions on pairs derived from more adjacent items in the sequence are associated with greater hippocampal activation. Hippocampal activation thus scales with the degree of relational processing necessary for TI judgments.

article,Zavecz2020B,"Long-term memory depends on memory consolidation that seems to rely on learning-induced changes in the brain activity. Here, we introduced a novel approach analyzing continuous EEG data to study learning-induced changes as well as trait-like characteristics in brain activity underlying consolidation. Thirty-one healthy young adults performed a learning task and their performance was retested after a short (~1h) delay, that enabled us to investigate the consolidation of serial-order and probability information simultaneously. EEG was recorded during a pre- and post-learning rest period and during learning. To investigate the brain activity associated with consolidation performance, we quantified similarities in EEG functional connectivity of learning and pre-learning rest (baseline similarity) as well as learning and post-learning rest (post-learning similarity). While comparable patterns of these two could indicate trait-like similarities, changes in similarity from baseline to post-learning could indicate learning-induced changes, possibly spontaneous reactivation. Individuals with higher learning-induced changes in alpha frequency connectivity (8.5{\textendash}9.5 Hz) showed better consolidation of serial-order information. This effect was stronger for more distant channels, highlighting the role of long-range centro-parietal networks underlying the consolidation of serial-order information. The consolidation of probability information was associated with learning-induced changes in delta frequency connectivity (2.5{\textendash}3 Hz) and seemed to be dependent on more local, short-range connections. Beyond these associations with learning-induced changes, we also found substantial overlap between the baseline and post-learning similarity and their associations with consolidation performance, indicating that stable (trait-like) differences in functional connectivity networks may also be crucial for memory consolidation.Significance statement We studied memory consolidation in humans by characterizing how similarity in neural oscillatory patterns during learning and rest periods supports consolidation. Previous studies on similarity focused on learning-induced changes (including reactivation) and neglected the stable individual characteristics that are present over resting periods and learning. Moreover, learning-induced changes are predominantly studied invasively in rodents or with neuroimaging or event-related electrophysiology techniques in humans. Here, we introduced a novel approach that enabled us 1) to reveal both learning-induced changes and trait-like individual differences in brain activity and 2) to study learning-induced changes in humans by analyzing continuous EEG. We investigated the consolidation of two types of information and revealed distinct learning-induced changes and trait-like characteristics underlying the different memory processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Zavecz, Z. and Janacsek, K. and Simor, P. and Cohen, M.X. and Nemeth, D.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-19 10:06:56 +0100,2021-01-19 10:07:16 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.09.04.283002,,,,,2020.09.04.283002,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/04/2020.09.04.283002.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Similarity of brain activity patterns during learning and subsequent resting state predicts memory consolidation,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/04/2020.09.04.283002,,2020,

article,Zeithamova2018JN,"Motivation enhances memory by increasing hippocampal engagement during encoding. However, whether such increased hippocampal activation reflects encoding of the value of highly rewarding events per se is less understood. Here, using a monetary incentive encoding task with a novel manipulation, we tested in humans whether the hippocampus represents abstract reward value, independent of perceptual content. During functional MRI scanning, men and women studied object pairs, each preceded by a monetary reward cue indicating the amount of money they would receive if they successfully remembered the object pair at test. Reward cues varied on both the level of reward (penny, dime, and dollar) and visual form (picture or word) across trials to dissociate hippocampal responses to reward value from those reflecting the perceptual properties of the cues. Behaviorally, participants remembered pairs associated with the high reward (dollar) more often than pairs associated with lower rewards. Neural pattern-similarity analysis revealed that hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activation patterns discriminated between cues of different value regardless of their visual form, and that hippocampal discrimination of value was most pronounced in participants who showed the greatest behavioral sensitivity to reward. Strikingly, hippocampal patterns were most distinct for reward cues that differed in value but had similar visual appearance, consistent with theoretical proposals of hippocampal-pattern differentiation of competing representations. Our data illustrate how contextual representations within the hippocampus go beyond space and time to include information about the motivational salience of events, with hippocampal reward coding tracking the motivational impact on later memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Motivation, such as the promise of future rewards, enhances hippocampal engagement during encoding and promotes successful retention of events associated with valuable rewards. However, whether the hippocampus explicitly encodes reward value, dissociable from sensory information, is unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus forms abstract representation of valuable rewards, encoding conceptual rather than perceptual information about the motivational context of individual events. Reward representation within the hippocampus is associated with preferential retention of high-value events in memory. Furthermore, we show that hippocampal-pattern differentiation serves to emphasize differences between visually similar events with distinct motivational salience. Collectively, these findings indicate that hippocampal contextual representations enable individuals to distinguish the motivational value of events, leading to prioritized encoding of significant memories.",,,,,,,,,"Zeithamova, Dagmar and Gelman, Bernard D. and Frank, Lea and Preston, Alison R.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-14 15:33:06 +0100,2021-01-14 15:33:24 +0100,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0719-18.2018,,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/47/10093.full.pdf,,,,,,0270-6474,,,Journal of Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47,,,10093--10101,,,,Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,,,Abstract Representation of Prospective Reward in the Hippocampus,,,,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/47/10093,38,2018,
article,Zeithamova2012FHN,"A critical aspect of inferential reasoning is the ability to form relationships between items or events that were not experienced together. This review considers different perspectives on the role of the hippocampus in successful inferential reasoning during both memory encoding and retrieval. Intuitively, inference can be thought of as a logical process by which elements of individual existing memories are retrieved and recombined to answer novel questions. Such flexible retrieval is sub-served by the hippocampus and is thought to require specialized hippocampal encoding mechanisms that discretely code events such that event elements are individually accessible from memory. In addition to retrieval-based inference, recent research has also focused on hippocampal processes that support the combination of information acquired across multiple experiences during encoding. This mechanism suggests that by recalling past events during new experiences, connections can be created between newly formed and existing memories. Such hippocampally mediated memory integration would thus underlie the formation of networks of related memories that extend beyond direct experience to anticipate future judgments about the relationships between items and events. We also discuss integrative encoding in the context of emerging evidence linking the hippocampus to the formation of schemas as well as prospective theories of hippocampal function that suggest memories are actively constructed to anticipate future decisions and actions.",,,,,,,,,"Zeithamova, Dagmar and Schlichting, Margaret and Preston, Alison",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-30 14:02:47 +0100,2020-11-30 14:03:12 +0100,,,10.3389/fnhum.2012.00070,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5161,,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,The hippocampus and inferential reasoning: building memories to navigate future decisions,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00070,6,2012,

We demonstrated that with orthogonal weights modification to overcome catastrophic forgetting, and the context-dependent processing module to learn how to reuse a feature representation and a classifier for different contexts, a single network could acquire numerous context-dependent mapping rules in an online and continual manner, with as few as approximately ten samples to learn each.

Rodent studies suggest that memory consolidation depends on replay of stimulus-specific activity patterns during fast hippocampal ``ripple'' oscillations. Here, we measured replay in intracranial electroencephalography recordings in human epilepsy patients, and related replay to ripples. Stimulus-specific activity was identified using representational similarity analysis and then tracked during waking rest and sleep after encoding. Stimulus-specific gamma (30--90 Hz) activity during early (100--500 ms) and late (500--1200 ms) encoding is spontaneously reactivated during waking state and sleep, independent of later memory. Ripples during nREM sleep, but not during waking state, trigger replay of activity from the late time window specifically for remembered items. Ripple-triggered replay of activity from the early time window during nREM sleep is enhanced for forgotten items. These results provide the first electrophysiological evidence for replay related to memory consolidation in humans, and point to a prominent role of nREM ripple-triggered replay in consolidation processes.",,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Hui and Fell, Juergen and Axmacher, Nikolai",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-25 12:15:28 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1038/s41467-018-06553-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,Nature Communications,,,,,,,,,,,Oct,,,1,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,,,,,,,,Electrophysiological mechanisms of human memory consolidation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06553-y,9,2018,
article,Zhang2015CB,"Neural representations of specific stimuli rely on activity patterns in distributed neural assemblies [1, 2, 3, 4]. According to one influential view, these assemblies are characterized by synchronized gamma-band activity (GBA) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] that reflects stimulus-specific representations [12, 13, 14]. However, recent studies have shown that GBA is closely correlated with the overall amount of cellular activity and may be detrimental for precise representations of specific stimuli [15, 16]. Until now, the role of GBA for the formation of dynamically changing representations has been unknown. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis (RSA) [17] to intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data from ten presurgical epilepsy patients to identify stimulus-specific neural representations. Patients first learned and then retrieved their paths through virtual houses. Dynamic representations were identified by the rapidly changing distributions of frequency-specific global (spatial) activity patterns across the brain. We found that GBA patterns during successful (but not unsuccessful) retrieval of one sequence were more similar to activity during encoding of that same sequence compared to other sequences. The contribution of individual electrodes to these global representations was correlated with local similarity in individual electrodes (i.e., with RSA across time). Moreover, time-resolved RSA values were negatively correlated with the magnitude of iEEG gamma power: RSA values were higher at time points when gamma power was reduced. Both global and local representations relied on a small proportion of electrodes. These results show that behaviorally relevant neural representations of specific dynamically changing stimuli can be tracked by iEEG recordings and that they are associated with reductions of gamma power.",,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Hui and Fell, Juergen and Staresina, Bernhard P. and Weber, Bernd and Elger, Christian E. and Axmacher, Nikolai",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAZLi4vcGFwZXJzL3poYW5nMjAxNWNiLnBkZk8RAWYAAAAAAWYAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////w96aGFuZzIwMTVjYi5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAPi86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6emhhbmcyMDE1Y2IucGRmAA4AIAAPAHoAaABhAG4AZwAyADAAMQA1AGMAYgAuAHAAZABmAA8ADAAFAG0AYQBjAE8AUwASADxVc2Vycy93aXR0a3Vobi9Eb2N1bWVudHMvYmlibGlvZ3JhcGh5L3BhcGVycy96aGFuZzIwMTVjYi5wZGYAEwABLwAAFQACAA///wAAAAgADQAaACQAQAAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGq,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-09 10:56:54 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.011,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,,,Current Biology,,,,,,,,,,,Mar,,,5,,,635--640,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Gamma Power Reductions Accompany Stimulus-Specific Representations of Dynamic Events,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.011,25,2015,

However, characterizing these states is complicated by the fact that different oscillations are often coupled, such as gamma oscillations nested in theta in the hippocampus, and changes in coupling are thought to reflect distinct states. Here, we describe a new method to separate single oscillatory cycles into distinct states based on frequency and phase coupling. Using this method, we identified four theta-gamma coupling states in rat hippocampal CA1. These states differed in abundance across behaviors, phase synchrony with other hippocampal subregions, and neural coding properties suggesting that these states are functionally distinct. We captured cycle-to-cycle changes in oscillatory coupling states and found frequent switching between theta-gamma states showing that the hippocampus rapidly shifts between different functional states.

article,Zhang2001ITMI,"The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.",,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Y. and Brady, M. and Smith, S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-13 16:09:45 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1109/42.906424,,,,,,,,,,,,0278-0062,,,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,45--57,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,,,,,fmriprep,,Segmentation of brain {MR} images through a hidden Markov random field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/42.906424,20,2001,
article,Zhao2018JN,"Studies of human and rodent navigation often reveal a remarkable cross-species similarity between the cognitive and neural mechanisms of navigation. Such cross-species resemblance often overshadows some critical differences between how humans and nonhuman animals navigate. In this review, I propose that a navigation system requires both a storage system (i.e., representing spatial information) and a positioning system (i.e., sensing spatial information) to operate. I then argue that the way humans represent spatial information is different from that inferred from the cellular activity observed during rodent navigation. Such difference spans the whole hierarchy of spatial representation, from representing the structure of an environment to the representation of subregions of an environment, routes and paths, and the distance and direction relative to a goal location. These cross-species inconsistencies suggest that what we learn from rodent navigation does not always transfer to human navigation. Finally, I argue for closing the loop for the dominant, unidirectional animal-to-human approach in navigation research so that insights from behavioral studies of human navigation may also flow back to shed light on the cellular mechanisms of navigation for both humans and other mammals (i.e., a human-to-animal approach).",,,,,,,,,"Zhao, Mintao",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-11-26 19:01:20 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1152/jn.00781.2017,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-1598,,,Journal of Neurophysiology,,,,,,,,,,,Nov,,,5,,,2453--2465,,,,American Physiological Society,,,,,,"replay, review",,Human spatial representation: what we cannot learn from the studies of rodent navigation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00781.2017,120,2018,

The richness of this information, and the complexity inherent in interacting memory and decision processes, makes the quantitative model-driven analysis of such decisions very difficult. In this paper we present a general framework that is capable of addressing the theoretical and methodological barriers to building formal models of naturalistic memory-based decision making. Our framework implements established theories of memory search and decision making within a single integrated cognitive system, and uses computational language models to quantify the thoughts over which memory and decision processes operate. It can thus describe both the content of the information that is sampled from memory, as well as the processes involved in retrieving and evaluating this information in order to make a decision. Furthermore, our framework is tractable, and the parameters that characterize memory-based decisions can be recovered using thought-listing and choice data from existing experimental tasks, and in turn be used to make quantitative predictions regarding choice probability, length of deliberation, retrieved thoughts, and the effects of decision context.

article,Zheng2020B,"Theta and gamma rhythms temporally coordinate sequences of hippocampal place cell ensembles during active behaviors, while sharp wave-ripples coordinate place cell sequences during rest. We used a delayed match-to-place memory task to investigate whether such coordination of hippocampal place cell sequences is disrupted when memory errors occur. As rats approached a learned reward location, place cell sequences represented paths extending toward the reward location during correct trials. During error trials, paths coded by place cell sequences were significantly shorter as rats approached incorrect stop locations, with place cell sequences starting at a significantly delayed phase of the theta cycle. During rest, place cell sequences replayed representations of paths that were highly likely to end at the correct reward location during correct but not error trials. The relationship between place cell sequences and gamma rhythms, however, did not differ between correct and error trials.

article,Zhu2020B,"Neutral events preceding emotional experiences are thought to be better remembered by tagging them as significant to simulate future event predictions. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms how emotion transforms initially mundane events into strong memories remain unclear. By two behavioral and one fMRI studies with adapted sensory preconditioning paradigm, we show rapid neural reactivation and reorganization underlying emotion-tagged retroactive memory enhancement. Behaviorally, emotional tagging enhanced initial memory for neutral associations across the three studies. Neurally, emotional tagging potentiated reactivation of overlapping neural traces in the hippocampus and stimulus-relevant neocortex. Moreover, it induced large-scale hippocampal-neocortical reorganization supporting such retroactive benefit, as characterized by enhanced hippocampal-neocortical coupling modulated by the amygdala during online processing, and a shift from stimulus-relevant neocortex to transmodal prefrontal-parietal areas during offline post-tagging rest. Together, emotional tagging retroactively promotes associations between past neutral events through stimulating rapid reactivation of overlapping representations and reorganizing related memories into an integrated network.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,,,,"Zhu, Yannan and Zhang, Lingke and Zeng, Yimeng and Chen, Changming and Fern{\'a}ndez, Guill{\'e}n and Qin, Shaozheng",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2021-01-19 10:05:42 +0100,2021-01-19 10:05:59 +0100,,,10.1101/2020.09.09.285890,,,,,2020.09.09.285890,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/09/2020.09.09.285890.full.pdf,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,,,,,Emotional tagging retroactively promotes memory integration through rapid neural reactivation and reorganization,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/09/2020.09.09.285890,,2020,

article,Zola-Morgan1990S,"Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the hippocampal formation and related structures in the medial temporal lobe are important for learning and memory. Retrograde amnesia was studied prospectively in monkeys to understand the contribution of the hippocampal formation to memory function. Monkeys learned to discriminate 100 pairs of objects beginning 16, 12, 8, 4, and 2 weeks before the hippocampal formation was removed (20 different pairs at each time period). Two weeks after surgery, memory was assessed by presenting each of the 100 object pairs again for a single-choice trial. Normal monkeys exhibited forgetting; that is, they remembered recently learned objects better than objects learned many weeks earlier. Monkeys with hippocampal damage were severely impaired at remembering recently learned objects. In addition, they remembered objects learned long ago as well as normal monkeys did and significantly better than they remembered objects learned recently. These results show that the hippocampal formation is required for memory storage for only a limited period of time after learning. As time passes, its role in memory diminishes, and a more permanent memory gradually develops independently of the hippocampal formation, probably in neocortex.",,,,,,,,,"Zola-Morgan, SM and Squire, LR",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-29 14:20:52 +0100,2020-10-29 14:21:14 +0100,,,10.1126/science.2218534,,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/250/4978/288.full.pdf,,,,,,0036-8075,,,Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4978,,,288--290,,,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,,,The primate hippocampal formation: evidence for a time-limited role in memory storage,,,,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/250/4978/288,250,1990,
article,Zorowitz2020CP,"Anxiety disorders are characterized by a range of aberrations in the processing of and response to threat, but there is little clarity what core pathogenesis might underlie these symptoms. Here we propose that a particular set of unrealistically pessimistic assumptions can distort an agent's behavior and underlie a host of seemingly disparate anxiety symptoms. We formalize this hypothesis in a decision-theoretic analysis of maladaptive avoidance and a reinforcement learning model, which shows how a localized bias in beliefs can formally explain a range of phenomena related to anxiety. The core observation, implicit in standard decision-theoretic accounts of sequential evaluation, is that the potential for avoidance should be protective: If danger can be avoided later, it poses less threat now. We show how a violation of this assumption---via a pessimistic, false belief that later avoidance will be unsuccessful---leads to a characteristic, excessive propagation of fear and avoidance to situations far antecedent of threat. This single deviation can explain a range of features of anxious behavior, including exaggerated threat appraisals, fear generalization, and persistent avoidance. Simulations of the model reproduce laboratory demonstrations of abnormal decision-making in anxiety, including in situations of approach--avoid conflict and planning to avoid losses. The model also ties together a number of other seemingly disjoint phenomena in anxious disorders. For instance, learning under the pessimistic bias captures a hypothesis about the role of anxiety in the later development of depression. The bias itself offers a new formalization of classic insights from the psychiatric literature about the central role of maladaptive beliefs about control and self-efficacy in anxiety. This perspective also extends previous computational accounts of beliefs about control in mood disorders, which neglected the sequential aspects of choice.",,,,,,,,,"Zorowitz, Samuel and Momennejad, Ida and Daw, Nathaniel D.",,YnBsaXN0MDDSAQIDBFxyZWxhdGl2ZVBhdGhZYWxpYXNEYXRhXxAcLi4vcGFwZXJzL3pvcm93aXR6MjAyMGNwLnBkZk8RAXQAAAAAAXQAAgAABW1hY09TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCRAAB/////xJ6b3Jvd2l0ejIwMjBjcC5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/////AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgAACiBjdQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGcGFwZXJzAAIAQS86VXNlcnM6d2l0dGt1aG46RG9jdW1lbnRzOmJpYmxpb2dyYXBoeTpwYXBlcnM6em9yb3dpdHoyMDIwY3AucGRmAAAOACYAEgB6AG8AcgBvAHcAaQB0AHoAMgAwADIAMABjAHAALgBwAGQAZgAPAAwABQBtAGEAYwBPAFMAEgA/VXNlcnMvd2l0dGt1aG4vRG9jdW1lbnRzL2JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9wYXBlcnMvem9yb3dpdHoyMDIwY3AucGRmAAATAAEvAAAVAAIAD///AAAACAANABoAJABDAAAAAAAAAgEAAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbs=,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-09 10:26:43 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1162/cpsy_a_00026,,,,,,,,,,,,2379-6227,,,Computational Psychiatry,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,,,,1--17,,,,MIT Press - Journals,,,,,,computational psychiatry,,"Anxiety, Avoidance, and Sequential Evaluation",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/cpsy_a_00026,,2020,
article,Zurn2020PTRSBS,"Human learners acquire complex interconnected networks of relational knowledge. The capacity for such learning naturally depends on two factors: the architecture (or informational structure) of the knowledge network itself and the architecture of the computational unit---the brain---that encodes and processes the information. That is, learning is reliant on integrated network architectures at two levels: the epistemic and the computational, or the conceptual and the neural. Motivated by a wish to understand conventional human knowledge, here, we discuss emerging work assessing network constraints on the learnability of relational knowledge, and theories from statistical physics that instantiate the principles of thermodynamics and information theory to offer an explanatory model for such constraints. We then highlight similarities between those constraints on the learnability of relational networks, at one level, and the physical constraints on the development of interconnected patterns in neural systems, at another level, both leading to hierarchically modular networks. To support our discussion of these similarities, we employ an operational distinction between the modeller (e.g. the human brain), the model (e.g. a single human's knowledge) and the modelled (e.g. the information present in our experiences). We then turn to a philosophical discussion of whether and how we can extend our observations to a claim regarding explanation and mechanism for knowledge acquisition. What relation between hierarchical networks, at the conceptual and neural levels, best facilitate learning? Are the architectures of optimally learnable networks a topological reflection of the architectures of comparably developed neural networks? Finally, we contribute to a unified approach to hierarchies and levels in biological networks by proposing several epistemological norms for analysing the computational brain and social epistemes, and for developing pedagogical principles conducive to curious thought.",,,,,,,,,"Zurn, Perry and Bassett, Danielle S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-27 10:37:12 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:12 +0200,,,10.1098/rstb.2019.0323,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2970,,,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,1796,,,20190323,,,,The Royal Society,,,,,,koenigsberg,,Network architectures supporting learnability,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0323,375,2020,
article,Ouden2008CC,"Confronted with a rich sensory environment, the brain must learn statistical regularities across sensory domains to construct causal models of the world. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to furnish neurophysiological evidence that statistical associations are learnt, even when task-irrelevant. Subjects performed an audio-visual target-detection task while being exposed to distractor stimuli. Unknown to them, auditory distractors predicted the presence or absence of subsequent visual distractors. We modeled incidental learning of these associations using a Rescorla--Wagner (RW) model. Activity in primary visual cortex and putamen reflected learning-dependent surprise: these areas responded progressively more to unpredicted, and progressively less to predicted visual stimuli. Critically, this prediction-error response was observed even when the absence of a visual stimulus was surprising. We investigated the underlying mechanism by embedding the RW model into a DCM to show that auditory to visual connectivity changed significantly over time as a function of prediction error. Thus, consistent with predictive coding models of perception, associative learning is mediated by prediction-error dependent changes in connectivity. These results posit a dual role for prediction-error in encoding surprise and driving associative plasticity.",,,,,,,,,"den Ouden, Hanneke E.M. and Friston, Karl J. and Daw, Nathaniel D. and McIntosh, Anthony R. and Stephan, Klaas E.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-28 13:28:26 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1093/cercor/bhn161,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-3211,,,Cerebral Cortex,,,,,,,,,,,Sep,,,5,,,1175--1185,,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),,,,,,koenigsberg,,A Dual Role for Prediction Error in Associative Learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhn161,19,2008,

By contrast, cognitive science and psychology have moved towards tasks that are simple enough to allow for detailed computational modeling of people's choices.

article,Blakeman2019AE,"Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory suggests that the brain uses a 'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' learning system to achieve complex behavior. These two systems are complementary in that the 'neocortical' system relies on slow learning of distributed representations while the 'hippocampal' system relies on fast learning of pattern-separated representations. Both of these systems project to the striatum, which is a key neural structure in the brain's implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Current deep RL approaches share similarities with a 'neocortical' system because they slowly learn distributed representations through backpropagation in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). An ongoing criticism of such approaches is that they are data inefficient and lack flexibility. CLS theory suggests that the addition of a 'hippocampal' system could address these criticisms. In the present study we propose a novel algorithm known as Complementary Temporal Difference Learning (CTDL), which combines a DNN with a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to obtain the benefits of both a 'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' system. Key features of CTDL include the use of Temporal Difference (TD) error to update a SOM and the combination of a SOM and DNN to calculate action values. We evaluate CTDL on grid worlds and the Cart-Pole environment, and show several benefits over the classic Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach. These results demonstrate (1) the utility of complementary learning systems for the evaluation of actions, (2) that the TD error signal is a useful form of communication between the two systems and (3) the biological plausibility of the proposed approach.

article,Buzzega2020AE,"In Continual Learning, a Neural Network is trained on a stream of data whose distribution shifts over time. Under these assumptions, it is especially challenging to improve on classes appearing later in the stream while remaining accurate on previous ones. This is due to the infamous problem of catastrophic forgetting, which causes a quick performance degradation when the classifier focuses on learning new categories. Recent literature proposed various approaches to tackle this issue, often resorting to very sophisticated techniques. In this work, we show that naive rehearsal can be patched to achieve similar performance. We point out some shortcomings that restrain Experience Replay (ER) and propose five tricks to mitigate them. Experiments show that ER, thus enhanced, displays an accuracy gain of 51.2 and 26.9 percentage points on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets respectively (memory buffer size 1000). As a result, it surpasses current state-of-the-art rehearsal-based methods.

article,Carpenter1988C,"The adaptive resonance theory (ART) suggests a solution to the stability-plasticity dilemma facing designers of learning systems, namely how to design a learning system that will remain plastic, or adaptive, in response to significant events and yet remain stable in response to irrelevant events. ART architectures are discussed that are neural networks that self-organize stable recognition codes in real time in response to arbitrary sequences of input patterns. Within such an ART architecture, the process of adaptive pattern recognition is a special case of the more general cognitive process of hypothesis discovery, testing, search, classification, and learning. This property opens up the possibility of applying ART systems to more general problems of adaptively processing large abstract information sources and databases. The main computational properties of these ART architectures are outlined and contrasted with those of alternative learning and recognition systems.<>",,,,,,,,,"{Carpenter}, G.

article,Dubey2018AE,"What makes humans so good at solving seemingly complex video games? Unlike computers, humans bring in a great deal of prior knowledge about the world, enabling efficient decision making. This paper investigates the role of human priors for solving video games. Given a sample game, we conduct a series of ablation studies to quantify the importance of various priors on human performance. We do this by modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results indicate that general priors, such as the importance of objects and visual consistency, are critical for efficient game-play.

article,Dworkin2020AE,"Like many scientific disciplines, neuroscience has increasingly attempted to confront pervasive gender imbalances within the field. While much of the conversation has centered around publishing and conference participation, recent research in other fields has called attention to the prevalence of gender bias in citation practices. Because of the downstream effects that citations can have on visibility and career advancement, understanding and eliminating gender bias in citation practices is vital for addressing inequity in a scientific community. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of gender bias in the citation practices of neuroscientists. Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the citation practices of men, and is increasing over time as the field becomes more diverse. We develop a co-authorship network to assess homophily in researchers' social networks, and we find that men tend to overcite men even when their social networks are representative. We discuss possible mechanisms and consider how individual researchers might address these findings in their own practices.

We achieve stable learning at high throughput by combining decoupled acting and learning with a novel off-policy correction method called V-trace.

article,Fedus2020AE,"Experience replay is central to off-policy algorithms in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but there remain significant gaps in our understanding. We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay -- greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory.

article,Lavin2014FBN,"Pupil dilation under constant illumination is a physiological marker where modulation is related to several cognitive functions involved in daily decision making. There is evidence for a role of pupil dilation change during decision-making tasks associated with uncertainty, reward-prediction errors and surprise. However, while some work suggests that pupil dilation is mainly modulated by reward predictions, others point out that this marker is related to uncertainty signaling and surprise. Supporting the latter hypothesis, the neural substrate of this marker is related to noradrenaline (NA) activity which has been also related to uncertainty signaling. In this work we aimed to test whether pupil dilation is a marker for uncertainty and surprise in a learning task. We recorded pupil dilation responses in 10 participants performing the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a decision-making task that requires learning and constant monitoring of outcomes' feedback, which are important variables within the traditional study of human decision making. Results showed that pupil dilation changes were modulated by learned uncertainty and surprise regardless of feedback magnitudes. Interestingly, greater pupil dilation changes were found during positive feedback (PF) presentation when there was lower uncertainty about a future negative feedback (NF); and by surprise during NF presentation. These results support the hypothesis that pupil dilation is a marker of learned uncertainty, and may be used as a marker of NA activity facing unfamiliar situations in humans.",,,,,,,,,"{Lav{\'\i}n}, Claudio and San {Mart{\'\i}n}, {Ren{\'e}} and Rosales Jubal, Eduardo",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-02-28 17:49:13 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00218,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,koenigsberg; noradrenaline; pupil dilation,,Pupil dilation signals uncertainty and surprise in a learning gambling task,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00218,7,2014,

Here, we introduce graph learning, a growing and interdisciplinary field focused on studying how humans learn and represent networks in the world around them. We begin by describing established results from statistical learning showing that humans are adept at detecting differences in the transition probabilities between items in a sequence. We next present recent experiments that directly control for differences in transition probabilities, demonstrating that human behavior also depends critically on the abstract network structure of transitions.

article,Lynn2019aAE,"Humans communicate using systems of interconnected stimuli or concepts -- from language and music to literature and science -- yet it remains unclear how, if at all, the structure of these networks supports the communication of information. Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient and biased ways that humans process this information. Here we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system's network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly-connected modules -- the two defining features of hierarchical organization. Together, these results suggest that many real networks are constrained by the pressures of information transmission, and that these pressures select for specific structural features.

Recent approaches rely on domain general principles of learning and representation captured in artificial neural networks. Most current models, however, focus too closely on language itself. In humans, language is part of a larger system for acquiring, representing, and communicating about objects and situations in the physical and social world, and future machine language models should emulate such a system. We describe existing machine models linking language to concrete situations, and point toward extensions to address more abstract cases. Human language processing exploits complementary learning systems, including a deep neural network-like learning system that learns gradually as machine systems do, as well as a fast-learning system that supports learning new information quickly.

article,OReilly1994H,"The hippocampus and related structures are thought to be capable of (1) representing cortical activity in a way that minimizes overlap of the representations assigned to different cortical patterns (pattern separation); and (2) modifying synaptic connections so that these representations can later be reinstated from partial or noisy versions of the cortical activity pattern that was present at the time of storage (pattern completion). We point out that there is a trade-off between pattern separation and completion and propose that the unique anatomical and physiological properties of the hippocampus might serve to minimize this trade-off. We use analytical methods to determine quantitative estimates of both separation and completion for specified parameterized models of the hippocampus. These estimates are then used to evaluate the role of various properties and of the hippocampus, such as the activity levels seen in different hippocampal regions, synaptic potentiation and depression, the multi-layer connectivity of the system, and the relatively focused and strong mossy fiber projections. This analysis is focused on the feedforward pathways from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the dentate gyrus (DG) and region CA3. Among our results are the following: (1) Hebbian synaptic modification (LTP) facilitates completion but reduces separation, unless the strengths of synapses from inactive presynaptic units to active postsynaptic units are reduced (LTD). (2) Multiple layers, as in EC to DG to CA3, allow the compounding of pattern separation, but not pattern completion. (3) The variance of the input signal carried by the mossy fibers is important for separation, not the raw strength, which may explain why the mossy fiber inputs are few and relatively strong, rather than many and relatively weak like the other hippocampal pathways. (4) The EC projects to CA3 both directly and indirectly via the DG, which suggests that the two-stage pathway may dominate during pattern separation and the one-stage pathway may dominate during completion; methods the hippocampus may use to enhance this effect are discussed. {\copyright} 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,,,,,,,,"{O'Reilly}, Randall C. and McClelland, James L.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-02 10:54:13 +0100,2020-12-30 17:13:15 +0100,,,10.1002/hipo.450040605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hippocampus,,,"memory, mathematical models, pattern separation, pattern completion, computer simulation",,,,,,,,,,,6,,,661-682,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hippocampal conjunctive encoding, storage, and recall: Avoiding a trade-off",,,,,,4,1994,
article,OToole2007JCN,"The goal of pattern-based classification of functional neuroimaging data is to link individual brain activation patterns to the experimental conditions experienced during the scans. These ``brain-reading'' analyses advance functional neuroimaging on three fronts. From a technical standpoint, pattern-based classifiers overcome fatal f laws in the status quo inferential and exploratory multivariate approaches by combining pattern-based analyses with a direct link to experimental variables. In theoretical terms, the results that emerge from pattern-based classifiers can offer insight into the nature of neural representations. This shifts the emphasis in functional neuroimaging studies away from localizing brain activity toward understanding how patterns of brain activity encode information. From a practical point of view, pattern-based classifiers are already well established and understood in many areas of cognitive science. These tools are familiar to many researchers and provide a quantitatively sound and qualitatively satisfying answer to most questions addressed in functional neuroimaging studies. Here, we examine the theoretical, statistical, and practical underpinnings of pattern-based classification approaches to functional neuroimaging analyses.

article,Op-de-Beeck2010aN,"Various arguments have been proposed for or against sub-voxel sensitivity or hyperacuity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at standard resolution. Sub-voxel sensitivity might exist, but nevertheless the performance of multi-voxel fMRI analyses is very likely to be dominated by a larger-scale organization, even if this organization is very weak. Up to now, most arguments are indirect in nature: they do not in themselves proof or contradict sub-voxel sensitivity, but they are suggestive, seem consistent or not with sub-voxel sensitivity, or show that the principle might or might not work. Here the previously proposed smoothing argument against hyperacuity is extended with simulations that include more realistic signal, noise, and analysis properties than any of the simulations presented before. These simulations confirm the relevance of the smoothing approach to find out the scale of the functional maps that underlie the outcome of multi-voxel analyses, at least in relative terms (differences in the scale of different maps). However, image smoothing, like most other arguments in the literature, is an indirect argument, and at the end of the day such arguments are not sufficient to decide the issue on whether and how much sub-voxel maps contribute. A few suggestions are made about the type of evidence that is needed to help us understand the as yet mysterious underpinnings of multi-voxel fMRI analyses.",,,,,,,,,"{Op de Beeck}, Hans P.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 13:49:40 +0200,2020-07-20 14:46:07 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.072,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,2,,,567--571,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Probing the mysterious underpinnings of multi-voxel {fMRI} analyses,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.072,50,2010,
article,Op-de-Beeck2010N,"Recently it has been suggested that multivariate analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can detect high spatial frequency components of cortical signals, like sub-millimeter columns. This `hyperacuity' seems to be at odds with the common assumption that the fMRI signal has a low spatial resolution due to the spatial spread of the underlying hemodynamic events. To resolve this apparent contradiction, I checked a very straightforward prediction of the hyperacuity hypothesis: if multivariate analyses are picking up a small-scale functional organization, then it can be expected that smoothing will be detrimental to the ability to decode these fine-scale spatial signals. I tested this prediction using data obtained with two paradigms to which multivariate techniques have been applied previously, including the decoding of grating orientation from the pattern of activity in primary visual cortex. It was found that smoothing does not decrease the sensitivity of multivariate analyses. Further simulations in which the scale of cortical organization was known indicate that this effect of smoothing contradicts the idea that the patterns detected with multivariate techniques reflect a fine-scale spatial organization.",,,,,,,,,"{Op de Beeck}, Hans P.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-07-20 12:53:32 +0200,2020-07-20 14:47:30 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.047,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Feb,,,3,,,1943--1948,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,,,Against hyperacuity in brain reading: Spatial smoothing does not hurt multivariate {fMRI} analyses?,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.047,49,2010,
inproceedings,Ponzi2007IJCNN,"Reverse replay of recent behavioural sequences immediately after experience at the reward location has recently been reported. Here we suggest a simple model of how such replay can be used to select an action and provide a reinforcement signal in the temporal credit assignment problem. When reward is found, replay of recent states experienced prior to discovery of reward is generated as a type of working memory. This acts to reinforces the actions associated with the replayed states, which are necessarily the actions which led to the reward being found, while other competing actions are not reinforced by the replay. On the other hand, actions which are selected but are not reinforced are punished. Here we suggest a firing rate neural network model implementation of this system based on the Basal-Ganglia anatomy with input from a cortical association layer generating replay and auto-catalytic feedback from the dopamine system as a reward signal modulating three-way Hebbian long term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) at the cortical-striatal synapses. The model is illustrated by numerical simulations of a simple example -that of associating a cue signal to a correct action to obtain reward after a delay period, typical of primate cue reward tasks. Through the learning the model shows a transition from an exploratory phase where actions are generated randomly, to a goal directed phase where the animal always chooses the correct action for each experienced state.",,,,,,,,,"{Ponzi}, A.",,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,,,,,2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,,,,,,2021-01-12 14:04:58 +0100,2021-01-12 14:05:46 +0100,,,10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371440,,,,,,,,,,,,2161-4407,,,International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,,,Hebbian learning;neural nets;working memory;action selection;temporal credit assignment;behavioural sequence;reward location;action replay;reinforcement signal;reward discovery;firing rate neural network model;Basal-Ganglia anatomy;cortical association layer;autocatalytic feedback;dopamine system;reward signal;Hebbian long term potentiation;Hebbian long term depression;cortical-striatal synapsis;numerical simulation;cue signal;action correction;learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Basal ganglia;Switches;Anatomy;Signal generators;Neurofeedback;Numerical simulation;Delay;Animals,,,,,,,,Aug,,,,,,3011-3016,,,,,,,,,,,,"Replay, Working Memory and Action Selection in Temporal Credit Assignment - a Simple Neural Network Model",,,,,,,2007,

article,Riemer2018AE,"Lack of performance when it comes to continual learning over non-stationary distributions of data remains a major challenge in scaling neural network learning to more human realistic settings. In this work we propose a new conceptualization of the continual learning problem in terms of a temporally symmetric trade-off between transfer and interference that can be optimized by enforcing gradient alignment across examples. We then propose a new algorithm, Meta-Experience Replay (MER), that directly exploits this view by combining experience replay with optimization based meta-learning. This method learns parameters that make interference based on future gradients less likely and transfer based on future gradients more likely. We conduct experiments across continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks and non-stationary reinforcement learning environments demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for continual learning. Our experiments show that the gap between the performance of MER and baseline algorithms grows both as the environment gets more non-stationary and as the fraction of the total experiences stored gets smaller.",,Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181011910R,,,,arXiv,,"{Riemer}, Matthew and {Cases}, Ignacio and {Ajemian}, Robert and {Liu}, Miao and {Rish}, Irina and {Tu}, Yuhai and {Tesauro}, Gerald",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-10-26 14:45:53 +0100,2020-10-26 14:46:28 +0100,,,,,,,arXiv:1810.11910,,1810.11910,,,,,,,,,arXiv e-prints,,,"Computer Science - Machine Learning, Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence, Statistics - Machine Learning",,,,,,,,October,,,,,,arXiv:1810.11910,,cs.LG,,,,,,,,,,{Learning to Learn without Forgetting by Maximizing Transfer and Minimizing Interference},,,,,,,2018,
article,Saxe2020AE,"Neuroscience research is undergoing a minor revolution. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This perspective has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterise computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory, and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a roadmap for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics, and neural representation in artificial and biological systems. We highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.

article,Wayne2018AE,"Animals execute goal-directed behaviours despite the limited range and scope of their sensors. To cope, they explore environments and store memories maintaining estimates of important information that is not presently available. Recently, progress has been made with artificial intelligence (AI) agents that learn to perform tasks from sensory input, even at a human level, by merging reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with deep neural networks, and the excitement surrounding these results has led to the pursuit of related ideas as explanations of non-human animal learning. However, we demonstrate that contemporary RL algorithms struggle to solve simple tasks when enough information is concealed from the sensors of the agent, a property called ""partial observability"". An obvious requirement for handling partially observed tasks is access to extensive memory, but we show memory is not enough; it is critical that the right information be stored in the right format. We develop a model, the Memory, RL, and Inference Network (MERLIN), in which memory formation is guided by a process of predictive modeling. MERLIN facilitates the solution of tasks in 3D virtual reality environments for which partial observability is severe and memories must be maintained over long durations. Our model demonstrates a single learning agent architecture that can solve canonical behavioural tasks in psychology and neurobiology without strong simplifying assumptions about the dimensionality of sensory input or the duration of experiences.

Such `replay' has been proposed as a mechanism necessary for a range of neurobiological functions, including systems memory consolidation, recall and spatial working memory, navigational planning, and reinforcement learning. Focusing mainly, but not exclusively, on work conducted in rodents, we describe the methodologies used to analyse replay and review evidence for its putative roles. We identify outstanding questions as well as apparent inconsistencies in existing data, making suggestions as to how these might be resolved.

article,Olafsdottir2017N,"Reactivation of hippocampal place cell sequences during behavioral immobility and rest has been linked with both memory consolidation and navigational planning. Yet it remains to be investigated whether these functions are temporally segregated, occurring during different behavioral states. During a self-paced spatial task, awake hippocampal replay occurring either immediately before movement toward a reward location or just after arrival at a reward location preferentially involved cells consistent with the current trajectory. In contrast, during periods of extended immobility, no such biases were evident. Notably, the occurrence of task-focused reactivations predicted the accuracy of subsequent spatial decisions. Additionally, during immobility, but not periods preceding or succeeding movement, grid cells in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex replayed coherently with the hippocampus. Thus, hippocampal reactivations dynamically and abruptly switch between operational modes in response to task demands, plausibly moving from a state favoring navigational planning to one geared toward memory consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"{\'O}lafsd{\'o}ttir, H.

article,de-Cothi2020B,"Much of our understanding of navigation has come from the study of rats, humans and simulated artificial agents. To date little attempt has been made to integrate these approaches into a common framework to understand mechanisms that may be shared across mammals and the extent to which different instantiations of agents best capture mammalian navigation behaviour. Here, we report a comparison of rats, humans and reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a novel open-field navigation task (`Tartarus Maze') requiring dynamic adaptation (shortcuts and detours) to changing obstructions in the path to the goal. We find humans and rats are remarkably similar in patterns of choice in the task.

article,de-Voogd2016N,"Emotionally arousing experiences are typically well remembered not only due to immediate effects at encoding, but also through further strengthening of subsequent consolidation processes. A large body of research shows how neuromodulatory systems promote synaptic consolidation. However, how emotionally arousing experiences alter systems-level interactions, presumably a consequence of modifications at a synaptic level, remains unclear. Animal models predict that memory traces are maintained by spontaneous reactivations across hippocampal--neocortical circuits during ``offline'' periods such as post-learning rest, and suggest this might be stronger for emotional memories. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis in humans using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Participants underwent a two-category localizer paradigm followed by a categorical differential delay fear conditioning paradigm interleaved with blocks of awake rest. Counterbalanced across participants, exemplars of one category (CS +), but not the other (CS −), were paired with mild electrical shocks. Fear recall (differential conditioned pupil dilation) was tested 24 h later. Analyses of the localizer paradigm replicate earlier work showing category-specific response patterns in neocortical higher-order visual regions. Critically, we show that during post-learning rest, spontaneous reactivation of these neocortical patterns was stronger for the CS + than the CS − category. Furthermore, hippocampal connectivity with the regions exhibiting these reactivations predicted strength of fear recall 24 h later. We conclude that emotional arousal during learning promotes spontaneous post-learning reactivation of neocortical representations of recent experiences, which leads to better memory when coinciding with hippocampal connectivity. Our findings reveal a systems-level mechanism that may explain the persistence of long-term memory for emotional experiences.",,,,,,,,,"{de Voogd}, Lycia D. and Fern{\'a}ndez, Guill{\'e}n and Hermans, Erno J.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-19 11:42:42 +0100,2020-03-31 14:28:13 +0200,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.04.026,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,,,NeuroImage,,,,,,,,,,,Jul,,,,,,563--572,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,reactivation; fMRI; human,,Awake reactivation of emotional memory traces through hippocampal--neocortical interactions,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.04.026,134,2016,

article,de-Zwart2009N,"The interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies based on blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast generally relies on the assumption of a linear relationship between evoked neuronal activity and fMRI response. While nonlinearities in this relationship have been suggested by a number of studies, it remains unclear to what extent they relate to the neurovascular response and are therefore inherent to BOLD fMRI. Full characterization of potential vascular nonlinearities is required for accurate inferences about the neuronal system under study. To investigate the extent of vascular nonlinearities, evoked activity was studied in humans with BOLD fMRI (n = 28) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) (n = 5). Brief (600--800 ms) rapidly repeated (1 Hz) visual stimuli were delivered using a stimulation paradigm that minimized neuronal nonlinearities. Nevertheless, BOLD fMRI experiments showed substantial remaining nonlinearities. The smallest stimulus separation (200--400 ms) resulted in significant response broadening (15--20% amplitude decrease; 10--12% latency increase; 6--14% duration increase) with respect to a linear prediction. The substantial slowing and widening of the response in the presence of preceding stimuli suggest a vascular rather than neuronal origin to the observed nonlinearity. This was confirmed by the MEG data, which showed no significant neuro-electric nonlinear interactions between stimuli as little as 200 ms apart. The presence of substantial vascular nonlinearities has important implications for rapid event-related studies by fMRI and other imaging modalities that infer neuronal activity from hemodynamic parameters.",,,,,,,,,"{de Zwart}, Jacco A. and {van Gelderen}, Peter and Jansma, J.

article,de-la-Prida2020PTRSBS,"Sharp-wave ripples are complex neurophysiological events recorded along the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit (i.e. from CA3 to CA1 and the subiculum) during slow-wave sleep and awake states. They arise locally but scale brain-wide to the hippocampal target regions at cortical and subcortical structures. During these events, neuronal firing sequences are replayed retrospectively or prospectively and in the forward or reverse order as defined by experience. They could reflect either pre-configured firing sequences, learned sequences or an option space to inform subsequent decisions. How can different sequences arise during sharp-wave ripples? Emerging data suggest the hippocampal circuit is organized in different loops across the proximal (close to dentate gyrus) and distal (close to entorhinal cortex) axis. These data also disclose a so-far neglected laminar organization of the hippocampal output during sharp-wave events. Here, I discuss whether by incorporating cell-type-specific mechanisms converging on deep and superficial CA1 sublayers along the proximodistal axis, some novel factors influencing the organization of hippocampal sequences could be unveiled.",,,,,,,,,"{de la Prida}, Liset M.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-11 15:26:42 +0200,2020-05-11 15:27:35 +0200,,,10.1098/rstb.2019.0236,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2970,,,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,Apr,,,1799,,,20190236,,,,The Royal Society,,,,,,replay,,Potential factors influencing replay across {CA1} during sharp-wave ripples,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0236,375,2020,

article,van-Kesteren2010PNAS,"The hippocampus is thought to promote gradual incorporation of novel information into long-term memory by binding, reactivating, and strengthening distributed cortical-cortical connections. Recent studies implicate a key role in this process for hippocampally driven crosstalk with the (ventro)medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is proposed to become a central node in such representational networks over time. The existence of a relevant prior associative network, or schema, may moreover facilitate this process. Thus, hippocampal-vmPFC crosstalk may support integration of new memories, particularly in the absence of a relevant prior schema. To address this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and prior schema manipulation to track hippocampal-vmPFC connectivity during encoding and postencoding rest. We manipulated prior schema knowledge by exposing 30 participants to the first part of a movie that was temporally scrambled for 15 participants. The next day, participants underwent fMRI while encoding the movie's final 15 min in original order and, subsequently, while resting. Schema knowledge and item recognition performance show that prior schema was successfully and selectively manipulated. Intersubject synchronization (ISS) and interregional partial correlation analyses furthermore show that stronger prior schema was associated with more vmPFC ISS and less hippocampal-vmPFC interregional connectivity during encoding. Notably, this connectivity pattern persisted during postencoding rest. These findings suggest that additional crosstalk between hippocampus and vmPFC is required to compensate for difficulty integrating novel information during encoding and provide tentative support for the notion that functionally relevant hippocampal-neocortical crosstalk persists during off-line periods after learning.",,,,,,,,,"{van Kesteren}, M.

article,van-de-Ven2020NC,"Artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Unlike humans, when these networks are trained on something new, they rapidly forget what was learned before. In the brain, a mechanism thought to be important for protecting memories is the reactivation of neuronal activity patterns representing those memories. In artificial neural networks, such memory replay can be implemented as `generative replay', which can successfully --and surprisingly efficiently --prevent catastrophic forgetting on toy examples even in a class-incremental learning scenario. However, scaling up generative replay to complicated problems with many tasks or complex inputs is challenging. We propose a new, brain-inspired variant of replay in which internal or hidden representations are replayed that are generated by the network's own, context-modulated feedback connections.

article,van-de-Ven2016N,"The ability to reinstate neuronal assemblies representing mnemonic information is thought to require their consolidation through offline reactivation during sleep/rest. To test this, we detected cell assembly patterns formed by repeated neuronal co-activations in the mouse hippocampus during exploration of spatial environments. We found that the reinstatement of assembly patterns representing a novel, but not a familiar, environment correlated with their offline reactivation and was impaired by closed-loop optogenetic disruption of sharp wave-ripple oscillations. Moreover, we discovered that reactivation was only required for the reinstatement of assembly patterns whose expression was gradually strengthened during encoding of a novel place. The context-dependent reinstatement of assembly patterns whose expression did not gain in strength beyond the first few minutes of spatial encoding was not dependent on reactivation. This demonstrates that the hippocampus can hold concurrent representations of space that markedly differ in their encoding dynamics and their dependence on offline reactivation for consolidation.",,,,,,,,,"{van de Ven}, Gido M. and Trouche, St{\'e}phanie and McNamara, Colin G. and Allen, Kevin and Dupret, David",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-09 11:57:46 +0100,2020-11-24 07:56:20 +0100,,,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.020,,,,,,,,,,,,0896-6273,,,Neuron,,,,,,,,,,,Dec,,,5,,,968--974,,,,Elsevier BV,,,,,,replay; ripples,,Hippocampal Offline Reactivation Consolidates Recently Formed Cell Assembly Patterns during Sharp Wave-Ripples,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.020,92,2016,
article,van-de-Ven2018AE,"A major obstacle to developing artificial intelligence applications capable of true lifelong learning is that artificial neural networks quickly or catastrophically forget previously learned tasks when trained on a new one. Numerous methods for alleviating catastrophic forgetting are currently being proposed, but differences in evaluation protocols make it difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred. In contrast, generative replay combined with distillation (i.e., using class probabilities as ""soft targets"") achieved superior performance in all three scenarios. Addressing the issue of efficiency, we reduced the computational cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main model by equipping it with generative feedback or backward connections. This Replay-through-Feedback approach substantially shortened training time with no or negligible loss in performance. We believe this to be an important first step towards making the powerful technique of generative replay scalable to real-world continual learning applications.",,,,,,,,,"{van de Ven}, Gido M. and {Tolias}, Andreas S.",,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,,,,,,,,,,,2020-04-17 10:37:23 +0200,2020-11-18 20:34:25 +0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv e-prints,,,"Computer Science - Machine Learning, Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Statistics - Machine Learning",,,,,,,,September,,,,,,arXiv:1809.10635,,,,,,,,,,,,{Generative replay with feedback connections as a general strategy for continual learning},,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180910635V,,2018,
article,van-der-Meer2011JN,"A functional interaction between the hippocampal formation and the ventral striatum is thought to contribute to the learning and expression of associations between places and rewards. However, the mechanism of how such associations may be learned and used is currently unknown. We recorded neural ensembles and local field potentials from the ventral striatum and CA1 simultaneously as rats ran a modified T-maze. Theta-modulated cells in ventral striatum almost invariably showed firing phase precession relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm. Across the population of ventral striatal cells, phase precession was preferentially associated with an anticipatory ramping of activity up to the reward sites. In contrast, CA1 population activity and phase precession were distributed more uniformly. Ventral striatal phase precession was stronger to hippocampal than ventral striatal theta and was accompanied by increased theta coherence with hippocampus, suggesting that this effect is hippocampally derived. These results suggest that the firing phase of ventral striatal neurons contains motivationally relevant information and that phase precession serves to bind hippocampal place representations to ventral striatal representations of reward.",,,,,,,,,"{van der Meer}, M.

article,van-der-Meer2009FIN,"Flexible decision-making strategies (such as planning) are a key component of adaptive behavior, yet their neural mechanisms have remained resistant to experimental analysis. Theories of planning require prediction and evaluation of potential future rewards, suggesting that reward signals may covertly appear at decision points. To test this idea, we recorded ensembles of ventral striatal neurons on a spatial decision task, in which hippocampal ensembles are known to represent future possibilities at decision points. We found representations of reward which were not only activated at actual reward delivery sites, but also at a high-cost choice point and before error correction. This expectation-of-reward signal at decision points was apparent at both the single cell and the ensemble level, and vanished with behavioral automation. We conclude that ventral striatal representations of reward are more dynamic than suggested by previous reports of reward- and cue-responsive cells, and may provide the necessary signal for evaluation of internally generated possibilities considered during flexible decision-making.",,,,,,,,,"{van der Meer}, Matthijs A A. and Redish, A.

article,van-der-Meer2017H,"The decoding of a sensory or motor variable from neural activity benefits from a known ground truth against which decoding performance can be compared. In contrast, the decoding of covert, cognitive neural activity, such as occurs in memory recall or planning, typically cannot be compared to a known ground truth. As a result, it is unclear how decoders of such internally generated activity should be configured in practice. We suggest that if the true code for covert activity is unknown, decoders should be optimized for generalization performance using cross‐validation. Using ensemble recording data from hippocampal place cells, we show that this cross‐validation approach results in different decoding error, different optimal decoding parameters, and different distributions of error across the decoded variable space. In addition, we show that a minor modification to the commonly used Bayesian decoding procedure, which enables the use of spike density functions, results in substantially lower decoding errors. These results have implications for the interpretation of covert neural activity, and suggest easy‐to‐implement changes to commonly used procedures across domains, with applications to hippocampal place cells in particular.",,,,,,,,,"{van der Meer}, Matthijs A.

article,van-der-Meer2010FN,"Decisions can arise in different ways, such as from a gut feeling, doing what worked last time, or planful deliberation. Different decision-making systems are dissociable behaviorally, map onto distinct brain systems, and have different computational demands. For instance, ``model-free'' decision strategies use prediction errors to estimate scalar action values from previous experience, while ``model-based'' strategies leverage internal forward models to generate and evaluate potentially rich outcome expectancies. Animal learning studies indicate that expectancies may arise from different sources, including not only forward models but also Pavlovian associations, and the flexibility with which such representations impact behavior may depend on how they are generated. In the light of these considerations, we review the results of van der Meer and Redish (2009a) , who found that ventral striatal neurons that respond to reward delivery can also be activated at other points, notably at a decision point where hippocampal forward representations were also observed. These data suggest the possibility that ventral striatal reward representations contribute to model-based expectancies used in deliberative decision making. ",,,,,,,,,"{van der Meer}, Matthijs A.

article,van-der-Meer2012N,"Decisions result from an interaction between multiple functional systems acting in parallel to process information in very different ways, each with strengths and weaknesses. In this review, the authors address three action-selection components of decision-making: The Pavlovian system releases an action from a limited repertoire of potential actions, such as approaching learned stimuli. Like the Pavlovian system, the habit system is computationally fast but, unlike the Pavlovian system permits arbitrary stimulus-action pairings. These associations are a ``forward'' mechanism; when a situation is recognized, the action is released. In contrast, the deliberative system is flexible but takes time to process. The deliberative system uses knowledge of the causal structure of the world to search into the future, planning actions to maximize expected rewards. Deliberation depends on the ability to imagine future possibilities, including novel situations, and it allows decisions to be taken without having previously experienced the options. Various anatomical structures have been identified that carry out the information processing of each of these systems: hippocampus constitutes a map of the world that can be used for searching/imagining the future; dorsal striatal neurons represent situation-action associations; and ventral striatum maintains value representations for all three systems. Each system presents vulnerabilities to pathologies that can manifest as psychiatric disorders. Understanding these systems and their relation to neuroanatomy opens up a deeper way to treat the structural problems underlying various disorders.",,,,,,,,,"{van der Meer}, Matthijs and Kurth-Nelson, Zeb and Redish, A.
