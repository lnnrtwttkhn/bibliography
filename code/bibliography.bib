	Abstract = {Vascular responses to neural activity are exploited as the basis of a number of brain imaging techniques. The vascular response is thought to be too slow to resolve the temporal sequence of events involved in cognitive tasks, and hence, imaging studies of mental chronometry have relied on techniques such as the evoked potential. Using rapid functional MRI (fMRI) of single trials of two simple behavioral tasks, we demonstrate that while the microvascular response to the onset of neural activity is delayed consistently by several seconds, the relative timing between the onset of the fMRI responses in different brain areas appears preserved. We examined a number of parameters that characterize the fMRI response and determined that its onset time is best defined by the inflection point from the resting baseline. We have found that fMRI onset latencies determined in this manner correlate well with independently measurable parameters of the tasks such as reaction time or stimulus presentation time and can be used to determine the origin of processing delays during cognitive or perceptual tasks with a temporal accuracy of tens of milliseconds and spatial resolution of millimeters.},

@article{Menon1999TCS,
	Abstract = {A large body of research in human perception and cognition has been concerned with the segregation of mental events into their presumed hierarchical processing stages, the temporal aspect of such processing being termed `mental chronometry'. Advances in single-event functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have allowed the extraction of relative timing information between the onset of activity in different neural substrates as well as the duration of cognitive processing during a task, offering new opportunities in the study of human perception and cognition. Single-event fMRI studies have also facilitated increased spatial resolution in fMRI, allowing studies of columnar organization in humans. Important processes such as object recognition, binocular vision and other processes are thought to be organized at the columnar level; thus, these advances in the spatial and temporal capabilities of fMRI allow a new generation of cognitive and basic neuroscience studies to be performed, investigating the temporal and spatial relationships between these cortical sub-units. Such experiments bear a closer resemblance to single-unit or evoked-potential studies than to classical static brain activation maps and might serve as a bridge between primate electrophysiology and human studies. These advances are initially demonstrated only in simple visual and motor system tasks and it is likely to be several years before the techniques we describe are robust enough for general use.},

@article{Kim1997MRM,
	Abstract = {In fMRI, images can be collected in a very short time; therefore, high temporal resolution is possible in principle. However, the temporal resolution is limited by a blurred intrinsic hemodynamic response and a finite signal‐to‐noise ratio. To determine the upper limit of temporal resolution in a single area during repeated tasks, motor cortex activity was investigated during visually instructed finger movements. Without averaging, a sequence of four single‐finger movements with an execution time of approximately 2 s can be resolved when the delay time between consecutive sequences is at least 3 s. The hemodynamic response time is constant for each subject, but not among different subjects. The temporal resolution can be better when the signal from spatially distinct regions is examined. For a series of experiments involving a visually instructed delayed cued finger movement task with a well‐defined, independently determined, variable delay time, time courses in the motor area are distinct from each other in two experiments if the difference in delay time is as little as 2 s. The activation in the visual area due to the presentation of the task serves here as an internal time reference. By comparing a set of fMRI time courses in multiple distinct areas, serial neural processing may be investigated.},

	Abstract = {The concept of stimulus-specific memory traces, or engrams, suggests that the fate of individual memories can be tracked via empirically observable brain states. Recent advances in neuroscience have made it possible to discern these brain states in various ways. In animals, transgenics and optogenetics have allowed identifying distinct cell populations as engrams, which are necessary and sufficient for specific memory contents. In humans, individual memories have been associated with unique brain patterns via multivariate analysis techniques of electrophysiological and neuroimaging data. In the following chapter, we will review the advent of engram research in both animal and human memory studies. Specifically, we will provide methodological insights into multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis used to detect stimulus-specific memory traces in humans. We will conclude that the study of engrams goes beyond the understanding of general mechanisms of memory formation and retrieval, instead mastering the neurobiological mystery of individual memories.},

	Abstract = {The computational framework of reinforcement learning (RL) has allowed us to both understand biological brains and build successful artificial agents. However, in this opinion, we highlight open challenges for RL as a model of animal behaviour in natural environments. We ask how the external reward function is designed for biological systems, and how we can account for the context sensitivity of valuation. We summarise both old and new theories proposing that animals track current and desired internal states and seek to minimise the distance to a goal across multiple value dimensions. We suggest that this framework readily accounts for canonical phenomena observed in the fields of psychology, behavioural ecology, and economics, and recent findings from brain-imaging studies of value-guided decision-making.},

@article{Misaki2013N,
	Abstract = {We investigated the decoding of ocular dominance stimulations with millisecond-order timing difference from the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In our experiment, ocular dominance columns were activated by monocular visual stimulation with 500- or 100- ms onset differences. We observed that the event-related hemodynamic response (HDR) in the human visual cortex was sensitive to the subtle onset difference. The HDR shapes were related to the stimulus timings in various manners: the timing difference was represented in either the amplitude of positive peak, amplitude of negative peak, delay of peak time, or response duration of HDR. These complex relationships were different across voxels and subjects. To find an informative feature of HDR for discriminating the subtle timing difference of ocular dominance stimulations, we examined various characteristics of HDR including response amplitude, time to peak, full width at half-maximum response, as inputs for decoding analysis. Using a canonical HDR function for estimating the voxel's response did not yield good decoding scores, suggesting that information may reside in the variability of HDR shapes. Using all the values from the deconvolved HDR also showed low performance, which could be due to an over-fitting problem with the large data dimensionality. When using either positive or negative peak amplitude of the deconvolved HDR, high decoding performance could be achieved for both the 500ms and the 100ms onset differences. The high accuracy even for the 100ms difference, given that the signal was sampled at a TR of 250ms and 2×2×3-mm voxels, implies a possibility of spatiotemporally hyper-resolution decoding. Furthermore, both down-sampling and smoothing did not affect the decoding accuracies very much. These results suggest a complex spatiotemporal relationship between the multi-voxel pattern of the BOLD response and the population activation of neuronal columns. The demonstrated possibility of decoding stimulations for columnar-level organization with 100-ms onset difference using lower resolution imaging data may broaden the scope of application of the BOLD fMRI.},

	Abstract = {The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signal is a robust surrogate for local neuronal activity. However, it has been shown to vary substantially across subjects, brain regions, and repetitive measurements. This variability represents a limit to the precision of the BOLD response and the ability to reliably discriminate brain hemodynamic responses elicited by external stimuli or behavior that are nearby in time. While the temporal variability of the BOLD signal at human visual cortex has been found in the range of a few hundreds of milliseconds, the spatial distributions of the average and standard deviation of this temporal variability have not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fMRI measurements with a high sampling rate (10Hz) to map the latency, intra- and inter-subject variability of the evoked BOLD signal in human primary (V1) visual cortices using an event-related fMRI paradigm. The latency relative to the average BOLD signal evoked by 30 stimuli was estimated to be 0.03$\pm$0.20s. Within V1, the absolute value of the relative BOLD latency was found correlated to intra- and inter-subject temporal variability. After comparing these measures to retinotopic maps, we found that locations with V1 areas sensitive to smaller eccentricity have later responses and smaller inter-subject variabilities. These correlations were found from data with either short inter-stimulus interval (ISI; average 4s) or long ISI (average 30s). Maps of the relative latency as well as inter-/intra-subject variability were found visually asymmetric between hemispheres. Our results suggest that the latency and variability of regional BOLD signal measured with high spatiotemporal resolution may be used to detect regional differences in hemodynamics to inform fMRI studies. However, the physiological origins of timing index distributions and their hemispheric asymmetry remain to be investigated.},

We investigate the cortical mechanisms underlying imagery and spatial analysis in the visual domain using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging during the mental clock task. The time-resolved analysis of cortical activation from auditory perception to motor response reveals a sequential activation of the left and right posterior parietal cortex, suggesting that these regions perform distinct functions in this imagery task. This is confirmed by a trial-by-trial analysis of correlations between reaction time and onset, width, and amplitude of the hemodynamic response. These findings pose neurophysiological constraints on cognitive models of mental imagery.},

The specific shape of these responses is of some importance to the design and analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Using fMRI scanning, we examine here the characteristics and variability of hemodynamic responses from the central sulcus in human subjects during an event-related, simple reaction time task. Specifically, we determine the contribution of subject, day, and scanning session (within a day) to variability in the shape of evoked hemodynamic response. We find that while there is significant and substantial variability in the shape of responses collected across subjects, responses collected during multiple scans within a single subject are less variable. The results are discussed in terms of the impact of response variability upon sensitivity and specificity of analyses of event-related fMRI designs.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Many daily behaviors require us to actively focus on the current task and ignore all other distractions. Yet, ignoring everything else might hinder the ability to discover new ways to achieve the same goal. Here, we studied the neural mechanisms that support the spontaneous change to better strategies while an established strategy is executed. Multivariate neuroimaging analyses showed that before the spontaneous change to an alternative strategy, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) encoded information that was irrelevant for the current strategy but necessary for the later strategy. Importantly, this neural effect was related to future behavioral changes: information encoding in MPFC was changed only in participants who eventually switched their strategy and started before the actual strategy change. This allowed us to predict spontaneous strategy shifts ahead of time. These findings suggest that MPFC might internally simulate alternative strategies and shed new light on the organization of PFC.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for >10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Although the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been studied intensely for decades, its precise functions have remained elusive. We recently hypothesized that the OFC contains a ``cognitive map'' of task space in which the current state of the task is represented, and this representation is especially critical for behavior when states are unobservable from sensory input. To test this idea, we apply pattern-classification techniques to neuroimaging data from humans performing a decision-making task with 16 states. We show that unobservable task states can be decoded from activity in OFC, and decoding accuracy is related to task performance and the occurrence of individual behavioral errors. Moreover, similarity between the neural representations of consecutive states correlates with behavioral accuracy in corresponding state transitions. These results support the idea that OFC represents a cognitive map of task space and establish the feasibility of decoding state representations in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging.},
