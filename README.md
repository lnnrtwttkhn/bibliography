# Bibliography

## Description

This repository contains my entire bibliography.

## Overview

The `bibliography.bib` is inside the `/code` folder.
That way I can sync it with Seafile / Dropbox and provide a direct download link to Overleaf.

The `/papers` contains all `.pdf` files and will not be synced with the repo.

## Rules
* The `doi` file never contains `https://` etc.
* Don't worry about changing the capitalization of words in the title. LaTex / Overleaf / `apacite` handle this automatically! :clap:
